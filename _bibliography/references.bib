	abstract = {One of the advantages of event-related functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) is that it permits estimation of the shape of the hemodynamic response function ({HRF}) elicited by cognitive events. Although studies to date have focused almost exclusively on the magnitude of evoked {HRFs} across different tasks, there is growing interest in testing other statistics, such as the time-to-peak and duration of activation as well. Although there are many ways to estimate such parameters, we suggest three criteria for optimal estimation: 1) the relationship between parameter estimates and neural activity must be as transparent as possible; 2) parameter estimates should be independent of one another, so that true differences among conditions in one parameter (e.g., hemodynamic response delay) are not confused for apparent differences in other parameters (e.g., magnitude); and 3) statistical power should be maximized. In this work, we introduce a new modeling technique, based on the superposition of three inverse logit functions ({IL}), designed to achieve these criteria. In simulations based on real {fMRI} data, we compare the {IL} model with several other popular methods, including smooth finite impulse response ({FIR}) models, the canonical {HRF} with derivatives, nonlinear fits using a canonical {HRF}, and a standard canonical model. The {IL} model achieves the best overall balance between parameter interpretability and power. The {FIR} model was the next-best choice, with gains in power at some cost to parameter independence. We provide software implementing the {IL} model. Hum Brain Mapp 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) based brain connectivity analysis maps the functional networks of the brain by estimating the degree of synchronous neuronal activity between brain regions. Recent studies have demonstrated that “resting-state” {fMRI}-based brain connectivity conclusions may be erroneous when motion artifacts have a differential effect on {fMRI} {BOLD} signals for between group comparisons. A potential explanation could be that in-scanner displacement, due to rotational components, is not spatially constant in the whole brain. However, this localized nature of motion artifacts is poorly understood and is rarely considered in brain connectivity studies. In this study, we initially demonstrate the local correspondence between head displacement and the changes in the resting-state {fMRI} {BOLD} signal. Than, we investigate how connectivity strength is affected by the population-level variation in the spatial pattern of regional displacement. We introduce Regional Displacement Interaction ({RDI}), a new covariate parameter set for second-level connectivity analysis and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing motion related confounds in comparisons of groups with different voxel-vise displacement pattern and preprocessed using various nuisance regression methods. The effect of using {RDI} as second-level covariate is than demonstrated in autism-related group comparisons. The relationship between the proposed method and some of the prevailing subject-level nuisance regression techniques is evaluated. Our results show that, depending on experimental design, treating in-scanner head motion as a global confound may not be appropriate. The degree of displacement is highly variable among various brain regions, both within and between subjects. These regional differences bias correlation-based measures of brain connectivity. The inclusion of the proposed second-level covariate into the analysis successfully reduces artifactual motion-related group differences and preserves real neuronal differences, as demonstrated by the autism-related comparisons.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies have demonstrated a critical role for a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal junction ({RTPJ}) in "theory of mind" ({ToM}), or mental state reasoning. In other research, the {RTPJ} has been implicated in the deployment of attention to an unexpected stimulus. One hypothesis ("attention hypothesis") is that patterns of {RTPJ} activation in {ToM} tasks can be fully explained by appeal to attention: stimuli that apparently manipulate aspects of {ToM} are in fact manipulating aspects of attention. On an alternative hypothesis ("{ToM} hypothesis"), functional regions identified by {ToM} tasks are selective for {ToM}, and not just for any unexpected stimulus. Here, we used {fMRI} to test these competing hypotheses: are brain regions implicated in {ToM}, including the {RTPJ}, {LTPJ}, and precuneus, recruited specifically for mental states, or for any unexpected stimulus? We first identified brain regions implicated in {ToM}, using a standard paradigm: participants read stories about false beliefs and false physical representations (e.g., outdated photographs). Participants also read a new set of stories describing mental or physical states, which were unexpected or expected. Regions of interest analyses revealed a higher response in the {RTPJ}, {LTPJ}, and precuneus, for mental versus physical stories, but no difference for unexpected and expected stories. Whole-brain random effects analyses also revealed higher activation in these regions for mental versus physical stories. This pattern provides evidence for the {ToM} hypothesis: the response in these functional regions is selective for mental state content, whether that content is unexpected or expected.},

	abstract = {Multiple studies have demonstrated that resolution in working memory ({WM}) declines as the number of stored items increases. Discrete-resource models predict that this decline should reach a stable plateau at relatively small set sizes because item limits prevent additional information from being encoded into {WM} at larger set sizes. By contrast, flexible-resource models predict that the monotonic declines in precision will continue indefinitely as set size increases and resources are distributed without any fixed item limit. In the present work, we found that {WM} resolution exhibited monotonic declines until set size reached three items, after which resolution achieved a clear asymptote. Moreover, analyses of individual differences showed a strong correlation between each observer's item limit and the set size at which {WM} resolution achieved asymptote. These behavioral observations were corroborated by measurements of contralateral delay activity ({CDA}), an event-related potential waveform that tracks the number of items maintained during the delay period. {CDA} activity rose monotonically and achieved asymptote at a set size that predicted individual {WM} capacity. Moreover, this neural measure of on-line storage also predicted the set size at which mnemonic resolution reached a stable plateau for each observer. Thus, independent behavioral and neural measures of {WM} capacity support a clear prediction of discrete-resource models. Precision in visual {WM} reaches asymptote when individual item limits are exceeded.},

Participants from four age groups (9-, 12-, 15-, and 18-year-olds, total N = 119) played three types of distribution games and the Trust game with four different interaction partners: friends, antagonists, neutral classmates, and anonymous peers. Nine- and 12-year-olds showed similar levels of prosocial behavior to all interaction partners, whereas older adolescents showed increasing differentiation in prosocial behavior depending on the relation with peers, with most prosocial behavior toward friends. The age related increase in non-costly prosocial behavior toward friends was mediated by self-reported perspective-taking skills. Current findings extend existing evidence on the developmental patterns of fairness considerations from childhood into late adolescence. Together, we show that adolescents are increasingly better at incorporating social context into decision-making. Our findings further highlight the role of friendships as a significant social context for the development of prosocial behavior in early adolescence.},

	abstract = {I. Introduction {PAST} studies of antidepressants have focused almost exclusively on their effects on the metabolism and receptors of monoamine neurotransmitters in various brain regions. These studies have been extended to the molecular effects of antidepressants and have led to a profoundly expanded understanding of their actions in the central nervous system. For example, long-term administration of antidepressants decreases the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, down-regulates {cAMP}-dependent protein kinase, modulates the {mRNA} expression of central β-adrenoceptors and serotonin (5-{HT}) receptors, and alters the functional activity of specific G protein subunits and adenylyl cyclase (1). Taken together, these and many other recent observations clearly indicate that antidepressants interfere not only with the production and release of catecholamines and indolamines but also with the signal transduction of those neurotransmitters that have long been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression.More recently, additional target genes of antidepressant treatment have been identified, the most intriguing being those related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ({HPA}) activity. Altered regulation of this neuroendocrine system has been the subject of investigative efforts in depression research since Gibbons (2) reported more than 30 yr ago that plasma cortisol concentrations are elevated in depression and are normalized after clinical remission. Numerous clinical observations are consistent with the possibility that there is a causal link between {HPA} dysregulation and psychopathology (3). Recently, a large number of preclinical studies have provided evidence pointing in the same direction.},

	abstract = {Head motion in functional {MRI} and resting-state {MRI} is a major problem. Existing methods do not robustly reflect the true level of motion artifact for in vivo {fMRI} data. The primary issue is that current methods assume that motion is synchronized to the volume acquisition and thus ignore intra-volume motion. This manuscript covers three sections in the use of gold-standard motion-corrupted data to pursue an intra-volume motion correction. First, we present a way to get motion corrupted data with accurately known motion at the slice acquisition level. This technique simulates important data acquisition-related motion artifacts while acquiring real {BOLD} {MRI} data. It is based on a novel motion-injection pulse sequence that introduces known motion independently for every slice: Simulated Prospective Acquisition {CorrEction} ({SimPACE}). Secondly, with data acquired using {SimPACE}, we evaluate several motion correction and characterization techniques, including several commonly used {BOLD} signal- and motion parameter-based metrics. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel, slice-based motion correction technique. Our novel method, {SLice}-Oriented {MOtion} {COrrection} ({SLOMOCO}) performs better than the volumetric methods and, moreover, accurately detects the motion of independent slices, in this case equivalent to the known injected motion. We demonstrate that {SLOMOCO} can model and correct for nearly all effects of motion in {BOLD} data. Also, none of the commonly used motion metrics was observed to robustly identify motion corrupted events, especially in the most realistic scenario of sudden head movement. For some popular metrics, performance was poor even when using the ideal known slice motion instead of volumetric parameters. This has negative implications for methods relying on these metrics, such as recently proposed motion correction methods such as data censoring and global signal regression.},

From day 28 they were reared under either ‘enriched’ or ‘standard’ environmental conditions. At 75 days of age the animals were sacrificed, and the regional brain weights were compared with two (differentially reared) control groups. Whereas cortical weight was greater in the enriched than in the standard control rats, no differences were found between the corresponding {REM} sleep-deprived (i.e. clonidine-treated) groups. These results suggest that {REM} sleep deprivation and/or disturbances of central noradrenergic function during early development can counteract growth responses of the brain to environmental stimulation later in life.},

These individual differences are commonly assayed by studying intertemporal preferences, as revealed by choices between immediate and delayed rewards. In the brain, reward-based and goal-oriented decisions are believed to rely on the striatum and its interactions with other cortical and subcortical networks. However, it remains unknown which specific cortical-striatal tracts are involved in intertemporal decision making. We use connectivity analyses in both structural and functional {MRI} to further our understanding of the relationship between distinct corticostriatal networks and intertemporal preferences in humans. Our results revealed distinct striatal pathways that are differentially related to delay discounting. Structural and functional connectivity between striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex was associated with increased patience, whereas connectivity between subcortical areas and striatum was associated with increased impulsivity. These findings provide novel insights into how the anatomy and functioning of striatal circuits mediate individual differences in intertemporal choice.},

We demonstrate that the {RH} angular gyrus is active during {ASL} processing only in native signers (hearing, {ASL}-English bilinguals) but not in those who acquired {ASL} after puberty (hearing, native English speakers).

To address all-or-none compliance that is followed by missing outcomes, we construct a new estimation procedure for the intention-to-treat effect that maintains good randomisation-based properties under more plausible, nonignorable noncompliance and nonignorable missing-outcome conditions: the 'compound exclusion restriction' on the effect of assignment and the 'latent ignorability' of the missing data mechanism. We present both theoretical results and a simulation study. Moreover, we show how the two key concepts of compound exclusion and latent ignorability are relevant in more complicated settings, such as right censoring of a time-to-event outcome.},

Adolescence is often described as a period of heightened reactivity to emotions paired with reduced regulatory capacities, a combination suggested to contribute to risk-taking and susceptibility to peer influence during puberty. However, no longitudinal research has definitively linked these behavioral changes to underlying neural development. Here, 38 neurotypical participants underwent two {fMRI} sessions across the transition from late childhood (10 years) to early adolescence (13 years). Responses to affective facial displays exhibited a combination of general and emotion-specific changes in ventral striatum ({VS}), ventromedial {PFC}, amygdala, and temporal pole. Furthermore, {VS} activity increases correlated with decreases in susceptibility to peer influence and risky behavior. {VS} and amygdala responses were also significantly more negatively coupled in early adolescence than in late childhood while processing sad and happy versus neutral faces. Together, these results suggest that {VS} responses to viewing emotions may play a regulatory role that is critical to adolescent interpersonal functioning.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies suggest that developmental improvements in inhibitory control are primarily supported by changes in prefrontal executive function. However, studies are contradictory with respect to how activation in prefrontal regions changes with age, and they have yet to analyze longitudinal data using growth curve modeling, which allows characterization of dynamic processes of developmental change, individual differences in growth trajectories, and variables that predict any interindividual variability in trajectories. In this study, we present growth curves modeled from longitudinal {fMRI} data collected over 302 visits (across ages 9 to 26 years) from 123 human participants. Brain regions within circuits known to support motor response control, executive control, and error processing (i.e., aspects of inhibitory control) were investigated. Findings revealed distinct developmental trajectories for regions within each circuit and indicated that a hierarchical pattern of maturation of brain activation supports the gradual emergence of adult-like inhibitory control. Mean growth curves of activation in motor response control regions revealed no changes with age, although interindividual variability decreased with development, indicating equifinality with maturity. Activation in certain executive control regions decreased with age until adolescence, and variability was stable across development. Error-processing activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showed continued increases into adulthood and no significant interindividual variability across development, and was uniquely associated with task performance. These findings provide evidence that continued maturation of error-processing abilities supports the protracted development of inhibitory control over adolescence, while motor response control regions provide early-maturing foundational capacities and suggest that some executive control regions may buttress immature networks as error processing continues to mature.},

Here, we test recent theories that individuals place high subjective value on opportunities to communicate their thoughts and feelings to others and that doing so engages neural and cognitive mechanisms associated with reward. Five studies provided support for this hypothesis. Self-disclosure was strongly associated with increased activation in brain regions that form the mesolimbic dopamine system, including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. Moreover, individuals were willing to forgo money to disclose about the self. Two additional studies demonstrated that these effects stemmed from the independent value that individuals placed on self-referential thought and on simply sharing information with others. Together, these findings suggest that the human tendency to convey information about personal experience may arise from the intrinsic value associated with self-disclosure.},

Psychopathy and Machiavellianism showed moderate negative correlations with Big Five Agreeableness (rs = −0.39 and −0.44, respectively), but Narcissism did not (r = −0.04). However, Narcissism correlated positively with Big Five Extraversion (r = 0.46) and {HEXACO} Extraversion (r = 0.49). Correlations among the Dark Triad variables were explained satisfactorily by the {HEXACO} variables, but not by the Five-Factor Model variables.},

	abstract = {Running studies with high statistical power, while effect size estimates in psychology are often inaccurate, leads to a practical challenge when designing an experiment. This challenge can be addressed by performing sequential analyses while the data collection is still in progress. At an interim analysis, data collection can be stopped whenever the results are convincing enough to conclude that an effect is present, more data can be collected, or the study can be terminated whenever it is extremely unlikely that the predicted effect will be observed if data collection would be continued. Such interim analyses can be performed while controlling the Type 1 error rate. Sequential analyses can greatly improve the efficiency with which data are collected. Additional flexibility is provided by adaptive designs where sample sizes are increased on the basis of the observed effect size. The need for pre-registration, ways to prevent experimenter bias, and a comparison between Bayesian approaches and null-hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}) are discussed. Sequential analyses, which are widely used in large-scale medical trials, provide an efficient way to perform high-powered informative experiments. I hope this introduction will provide a practical primer that allows researchers to incorporate sequential analyses in their research. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background  Depression is associated with sleep disturbances, including alterations in rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep, that may relate to the neurobiology of the disorder. Given that {REM} sleep activates limbic and anterior paralimbic cortex and that depressed patients demonstrate increases in electroencephalographic sleep measures of {REM}, we hypothesized greater activation of these structures during waking to {REM} sleep in depressed patients.  Design  Subjects completed electroencephalographic sleep and regional cerebral glucose metabolism assessments during both waking and {REM} sleep using [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography.  Setting  Patients and healthy subjects recruited from the general community to participate in a research study of depression at an academic medical center.  Patients  Twenty-four unmedicated patients who met the Structured Clinical Interview for {DSM}-{IV} criteria for current major depression and who had a score of 15 or higher on a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; 14 medically healthy subjects of comparable age and sex who were free of mental disorders.  Main Outcome Measures  Electroencephalographic sleep, semiquantitative and relative regional cerebral metabolism during waking and {REM} sleep.  Results  Depressed patients showed greater {REM} sleep percentages. While both healthy and depressed patients activated anterior paralimbic structures from waking to {REM} sleep, the spatial extent of this activation was greater in the depressed patients. Additionally, depressed patients showed greater activation in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal, left premotor, primary sensorimotor, and left parietal cortices, as well as in the midbrain reticular formation.  Conclusions  Increased anterior paralimbic activation from waking to {REM} sleep may be related to affective dysregulation in depressed patients. Increased activation of executive cortex may be related to a cognitive dysregulation. These results suggest that altered function of limbic/anterior paralimbic and prefrontal circuits in depression is accentuated during the {REM} sleep state. The characteristic sleep disturbances of depression may reflect this dysregulation.},

	abstract = {The ability to flexibly respond to changes in the environment is critical for adaptive behavior. Reversal learning ({RL}) procedures test adaptive response updating when contingencies are altered. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain areas that support specific {RL} components. We compared neural responses to {RL} and initial learning (acquisition) to isolate reversal-related brain activation independent of cognitive control processes invoked during initial feedback-based learning. Lateral orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) was more activated during reversal than acquisition, suggesting its relevance for reformation of established stimulus–response associations. In addition, the dorsal anterior cingulate ({dACC}) and right inferior frontal gyrus ({rIFG}) correlated with change in postreversal accuracy. Because optimal {RL} likely requires suppression of a prior learned response, we hypothesized that similar regions serve both response inhibition ({RI}) and inhibition of learned associations during reversal. However, reversal-specific responding and stopping (requiring {RI} and assessed via the stop-signal task) revealed distinct frontal regions. Although {RI}-related regions do not appear to support inhibition of prepotent learned associations, a subset of these regions, {dACC} and {rIFG}, guide actions consistent with current reward contingencies. These regions and lateral {OFC} represent distinct neural components that support behavioral flexibility important for adaptive learning.},

	abstract = {Unilateral spatial neglect is a disorder of attention and spatial representation, in which early visual processes such as figure–ground segmentation have been assumed to be largely intact. There is evidence, however, that the spatial attention bias underlying neglect can bias the segmentation of a figural region from its background. Relatively few studies have explicitly examined the effect of spatial neglect on processing the figures that result from such scene segmentation. Here, we show that a neglect patient's bias in figure–ground segmentation directly influences his conscious recognition of these figures. By varying the relative salience of figural and background regions in static, two-dimensional displays, we show that competition between elements in such displays can modulate a neglect patient's ability to recognise parsed figures in a scene. The findings provide insight into the interaction between scene segmentation, explicit object recognition, and attention.},

Morality unites a society by limiting infringements upon the rights of other society members, so if larger societies are indeed more likely to split, then those that remain intact may be expected to have more effective inviolable moral rules, such as those imposed by moralizing gods. Cross-cultural analyses support this line of thought: more competition between societies is found in environments rich in resources and larger societies tend to occupy these environments; large societies engage in external conflicts at higher rates and are more often characterized by beliefs in moralizing gods. An additional explanation is briefly discussed, and we speculatively picture the historical chain of events giving rise to a belief in moralizing gods.},

Boys were videotaped interacting with a friend at ages 14, 16, and 18, and deviant content and interpersonal processes were independently coded. Conditional dyadic interpersonal processes were studied as a communication system and summarized by an index of information entropy (F. Attneave, 1959). High entropy scores represent disorganized, unpredictable patterns of interaction, whereas low entropy scores reflect an organized dialogue. Conversations of early-onset antisocial boys and their best friends were less organized and included more deviant content than those of well-adjusted controls. Prediction analyses, however, revealed an interaction between entropy and deviant talk. Consistent with expectation, males with well-organized interactions (i.e., low entropy) but elevated levels of deviant content were most likely to continue antisocial behavior into adulthood. Findings suggest that individual risk for maladaptation may be amplified by early adolescent friendship dynamics organized around deviance.},

	abstract = {Background
Depression has been linked to stress, memory deficits, and hypercortisolemia. However, the relationships between depression, hippocampal structure and function, and cortisol levels are unclear and the effects of antidepressant treatment on the measures are not well studied.
Methods
Whole hippocampal volume, performance on verbal and visual declarative memory function and cortisol status was evaluated in 38 subjects with major depressive disorder ({MDD}) and 33 healthy subjects. All measures were repeated in a subgroup (n = 22) of depressed patients after successful selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ({SSRI}) treatment.
Results
Hippocampal volume was not significantly different between patients with untreated {MMD} and healthy subjects, after controlling for whole brain volume, age and gender. However, depressed subjects had significantly greater deficits in delayed memory and percent retention on the verbal portion of the Wechsler Memory Scaleâ€”Revised ({WMS}-R) compared with healthy subjects, without significant differences in visual memory, attention, vigilance, or distractibility. Baseline plasma or urinary free cortisol ({UFC}) was not related to either hippocampal volume or memory deficits. Successful treatment with antidepressants did not change hippocampal volume but did result in a significant improvement in memory function and a reduction in {UFC} excretion.
Conclusions
Medication-free nonelderly depressed outpatients without alcohol dependence or adverse experiences in childhood had normal hippocampal volume. Focal declarative memory deficits in depression supported localized hippocampal dysfunction in depressed patients. Treatment with antidepressants significantly improved memory and depression but did not alter hippocampal volume, suggesting that antidepressants may improve hippocampal function in the absence of detectable structural changes.},

Social network analyses were used to measure a comprehensive representation of adolescents' social environment by covering individual, group, class, and school characteristics. Multilevel models revealed that individual characteristics as well as contextual factors predict adolescents' level of empathy.

Three hundred single-subject datasets from the 1,000 Functional Connectomes project were used to demonstrate the capabilities of the framework. Results A framework for easy implementation of processing pipelines was developed and an R package for the example implementation of Fully Exploratory Network {ICA} was compiled. Test runs on data from 300 subjects demonstrated the computational advantages of a processing pipeline developed using the framework compared to non-parallelized processing, reducing computation time by a factor of 15.

Social cognition comprises our ability to understand and respond appropriately to other people's social approaches or responses. The concept embraces self-knowledge and theory of mind, or the ability to think about emotions and behavior from the perspective of another person. The neuropeptides oxytocin ({OT}) and vasopressin ({AVP}) are now known to play an important role, affecting individual differences in parenting behavior, social recognition, and affiliative behaviors. The processes of social cognition are also supported by reward circuitry, underpinned by the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system. Reward processes build social relationships, in parenting and pair-bonding, and influence social interactions that require trust, or display altruism. The impact of emotional regulation upon social behavior, including mood and anxiety, is also mediated through the serotonergic system. Variation in activity of serotonergic networks in the brain influences emotional responsivity, including subjective feelings, physiological responses, emotional expressions, and the tendency to become engaged in action as a consequence of a feeling state. Genetic variation in the receptors associated with {OT}, {AVP}, dopamine, and serotonin has been intensively studied in humans and animal models.

The consequences of risky sexual behavior are of public concern. Adolescents contribute disproportionately to negative consequences of risky sexual behavior. However, no research has examined the neural correlates of impulse control and real-world engagement in risky sexual behavior in this population. The aim of the present study was to examine this question. Twenty sexually active adolescents performed an impulse control task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) scan and risky sexual behaviors were assessed through self-report. Sexual riskiness ratings were negatively associated with activation in the prefrontal cortex during response inhibition. These results suggest that diminished engagement of impulse control circuitry may contribute to sexual riskiness in adolescents.},

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that previous exposure to stress changes the action of the antidepressant drug citalopram (10 mg/kg, i.p.) on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ({HPA}) axis function, gene expression of selected neuropeptides and serotonin reuptake. Three different stress models were used, which included immobilization, restraint and unpredictable stress stimuli. Samples of plasma for hormone measurement were taken from conscious cannulated animals. Changes in corticotropin-releasing hormone ({CRH}) and proopiomelanocortin ({POMC}) gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary, respectively, and the ability of citalopram to inhibit serotonin reuptake were investigated. The exposure to three different stress models did not influence citalopram action on individual parameters of {HPA} axis and on serotonin reuptake. On the other hand, repeated administration of the drug led to significant attenuation of {ACTH} and {CRH} {mRNA} responses. The present results allow to suggest that the stressors used did not influence serotonergic neurotransmission to the extent that would modify {HPA} axis response to citalopram challenge. Activation of {HPA} axis by acute citalopram treatment was found to be accompanied by increased {CRH} gene expression in the hypothalamus. Repeated administration of the drug led to the development of tolerance to activation of central and peripheral components of {HPA} axis, but not to serotonin reuptake inhibition.},

The authors investigated the neurobiological basis of poor sleep and daytime fatigue in insomnia.


{METHOD}

[(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was used to assess regional cerebral glucose metabolism of seven patients with insomnia and 20 healthy subjects.


{RESULTS}

Compared with healthy subjects, patients with insomnia showed greater global cerebral glucose metabolism during sleep and while awake, a smaller decline in relative metabolism from waking to sleep states in wake-promoting regions, and reduced relative metabolism in the prefrontal cortex while awake.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Subjectively disturbed sleep in patients with insomnia is associated with greater brain metabolism. The inability to fall asleep may be related to a failure of arousal mechanisms to decline in activity from waking to sleep states. Further, daytime fatigue may reflect decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex resulting from inefficient sleep.},

It can be used to establish consensus on the locations of functional regions, test hypotheses developed from patient and animal studies and develop new hypotheses on structure–function correspondence. It is particularly valuable in neuroimaging because most studies do not adequately correct for multiple comparisons; based on statistical thresholds used, we estimate that roughly 10–20\% of reported activations in published studies are false positives. In this article, we briefly summarize some of the most popular meta-analytic approaches and their limitations, and we outline a revised multilevel approach with increased validity for establishing consistency across studies. We also discuss multivariate methods by which meta-analysis can be used to develop and test hypotheses about co-activity of brain regions. Finally, we argue that meta-analyses can make a uniquely valuable contribution to predicting psychological states from patterns of brain activity, and we briefly discuss some methods for making such predictions.},

The amount of mental effort investment that an individual experiences during task performance can be measured afterwards with the help of self-rating scales. Earlier research suggests that integration of information about somatic state changes is crucial for the self-evaluation of mental effort investment. Damage to the pathways which convey information about somatic state changes can lead to an inability to self-evaluate mental effort investment, while conceptually similar evaluations of task difficulty can still be performed. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activation, while subjects rated their mental effort investment and the difficulty of a previously performed task. Our results show stronger activation of the left anterior insular cortex ({aIC}) during evaluation of mental effort. Additionally, the activity in left {aIC} during task performance was modulated by changes in task demand in a similar way as the self-ratings of mental effort. We argue that {aIC} does not only play a role in the integration of self-related information during self-evaluation of mental effort investment, but that left {aIC} might also be involved in the experience of mental effort during task performance.},

The aim of the present study was to explore whether prototypical neutral faces are evaluated as displaying neutral emotions. Twenty-one subjects performed the Extrinsic Affective Simon Task ({EAST}), a validated implicit task that measures the emotional evaluation of target stimuli. All stimuli consisted of two juxtaposed faces from standardized facial pictures. The attribute stimuli (positive vs. negative), which needed to be classified on the basis of extrinsic valence, were presented as black and white facial pictures. The target stimuli were color-filtered positive, negative, neutral, and positive/negative faces, and subjects were instructed to classify them on the basis of the filtered color (blue vs. green). The responses to the positive target faces were associated with the positive emotions and the responses to the negative target faces were associated with the negative emotions. For the neutral faces, the responses were similar to those of negative faces, while for the positive/negative stimuli, the responses were undifferentiated. These findings suggested that prototypical “neutral” faces may be evaluated as negative in some circumstances, which suggests that the inclusion of neutral faces as a baseline condition might introduce an experimental confound in functional neuroimaging studies.},

Emotional expressiveness and empathy were evaluated in 73 children in 3 age groups (5-, 9-, and 13-year-olds) by measuring facial and verbal responses to emotionally evocative videotapes and by ratings from best friends, parents, and teachers. Measures of emotional insight and role taking were also obtained. Prosocial behaviors were assessed by 3 laboratory tasks and by ratings from best friends, parents, and teachers. Confirming expectations, latent variable path analyses (Lohmöller, 1984) indicated that emotional expressiveness, emotional insight, and role taking were strong predictors of latent empathy (multiple R$^{\textrm{2}}$ = .60). Boys' empathy, in turn, was a strong predictor of prosocial behavior, R$^{\textrm{2}}$ = .55. In contrast, girls' empathy was related to prosocial behaviors with friends, R$^{\textrm{2}}$ = .13, but not to cooperation with peers. Thus present findings provide important support and clarification for certain theoretical expectations, and also raise issues that need clarification.},

	abstract = {The central autonomic network ({CAN}) has been described in animal models but has been difficult to elucidate in humans. Potential confounds include physiological noise artifacts affecting brainstem neuroimaging data, and difficulty in deriving non-invasive continuous assessments of autonomic modulation. We have developed and implemented a new method which relates cardiac-gated {fMRI} timeseries with continuous-time heart rate variability ({HRV}) to estimate central autonomic processing. As many autonomic structures of interest are in brain regions strongly affected by cardiogenic pulsatility, we chose to cardiac-gate our {fMRI} acquisition to increase sensitivity. Cardiac-gating introduces T1-variability, which was corrected by transforming {fMRI} data to a fixed {TR} using a previously published method (). The electrocardiogram was analyzed with a novel point process adaptive-filter algorithm for computation of the high-frequency ({HF}) index, reflecting the time-varying dynamics of efferent cardiovagal modulation. Central command of cardiovagal outflow was inferred by using the {HF} timeseries resampled at as a regressor to the {fMRI} data. A grip task was used to perturb the autonomic nervous system. Our combined {HRV}-{fMRI} approach demonstrated {HF} correlation with {fMRI} activity in the hypothalamus, cerebellum, parabrachial nucleus/locus ceruleus, periaqueductal gray, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal, posterior insular, and middle temporal cortices. While some regions consistent with central cardiovagal control in animal models gave corroborative evidence for our methodology, other mostly higher cortical or limbic-related brain regions may be unique to humans. Our approach should be optimized and applied to study the human brain correlates of autonomic modulation for various stimuli in both physiological and pathological states.},

These changes in rs-{fcMRI} correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-{fcMRI} analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development.

Since 1906 when its uterine-contracting properties were described until 50 years later when its sequence was elucidated, research has focused on its peripheral roles in reproduction. Only over the past several decades have researchers focused on what functions Oxt might have in the brain, the subject of this review.
Immunohistochemical studies revealed that magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei are the neurons of origin for the Oxt released from the posterior pituitary. Smaller cells in various parts of the brain, as well as release from magnocellular dendrites, provide the Oxt responsible for modulating various behaviors at its only identified receptor.
Although Oxt is implicated in a variety of "non-social" behaviors, such as learning, anxiety, feeding and pain perception, it is Oxt's roles in various social behaviors that have come to the fore recently. Oxt is important for social memory and attachment, sexual and maternal behavior, and aggression. Recent work implicates Oxt in human bonding and trust as well. Human disorders characterized by aberrant social interactions, such as autism and schizophrenia, may also involve Oxt expression. Many, if not most, of Oxt's functions, from social interactions (affiliation, aggression) and sexual behavior to eventual parturition, lactation and maternal behavior, may be viewed as specifically facilitating species propagation.},

Elevated platelet serotonin (5-{HT}) in 20\%–25\% of cases and efficacy of selective 5-{HT} reuptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}) in treating anxiety, depression, and repetitive behaviors points to the 5-{HT} transporter (5-{HTT}; {SERT}) as a strong candidate gene. Association studies involving the functional insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter (5-{HTTLPR}) and a polymorphism in intron 2 are inconclusive, possibly because of phenotypic heterogeneity. Nonetheless, mounting evidence for genetic linkage of autism to the chromosome 17q11.2 region that harbors the {SERT} locus ({SLC}6A4) supports a genetic effect at or near this gene. We confirm recent reports of sex-biased genetic effects in 17q by showing highly significant linkage driven by families with only affected males. Association with common alleles fails to explain observed linkage; therefore, we hypothesized that preferential transmission of multiple alleles does explain it. From 120 families, most contributing to linkage at 17q11.2, we found four coding substitutions at highly conserved positions and 15 other variants in 5′ noncoding and other intronic regions transmitted in families exhibiting increased rigid-compulsive behaviors. In the aggregate, these variants show significant linkage to and association with autism. Our data provide strong support for a collection of multiple, often rare, alleles at {SLC}6A4 as imposing risk of autism.},

There was no evidence for accuracy of the baby-face stereotype, which was significantly inaccurate for adolescent boys.

Development of statistical methods to address missingness have been actively pursued in recent years, including imputation, likelihood and weighting approaches. Each approach is more complicated when there are many patterns of missing values, or when both categorical and continuous random variables are involved. Implementations of routines to incorporate observations with incomplete variables in regression models are now widely available. We review these routines in the context of a motivating example from a large health services research dataset. While there are still limitations to the current implementations, and additional efforts are required of the analyst, it is feasible to incorporate partially observed values, and these methods should be utilized in practice.},

Cross-sectional and longitudinal structural equation models supported the hypothesis that parents’ (mostly mothers’) positive expressivity mediated the relation between parental warmth and children's empathy, and children's empathy mediated the relation between parental positive expressivity and children's social functioning. These relations persisted after controlling for prior levels of parenting and child characteristics.

In the present study, we measured event-related potentials ({ERPs}) evoked by word-initial and word-medial syllables equated for loudness, length, and phonemic content. This comparison provided an online measure of natural speech segmentation. Word-initial sounds elicited a larger early sensory component (N100). In addition, we measured the effects of semantic and syntactic information on speech segmentation by comparing {ERPs} to word-initial and word-medial syllables in sentences with varying amounts of semantic and syntactic content. The results indicated that neither semantic nor syntactic information is necessary for the word-onset segmentation effect to be observed.

Several studies point towards an important role of the hippocampus and, additionally, other brain structures (e. g. amygdala, prefrontal cortex, suprachiasmatic nucleus) in the regulation of the {CAR}. There is increasing knowledge that the {CAR} is influenced by a variety of factors such as gender, health status, and health behavior or stress perception. However, the exact function of the profound cortisol increase after awakening is still not clarified. We hypothesize that the anticipation of the upcoming day is of major relevance for the magnitude of the {CAR}.

	abstract = {The anthropological record indicates that approximately 85 per cent of human societies have permitted men to have more than one wife (polygynous marriage), and both empirical and evolutionary considerations suggest that large absolute differences in wealth should favour more polygynous marriages. Yet, monogamous marriage has spread across Europe, and more recently across the globe, even as absolute wealth differences have expanded. Here, we develop and explore the hypothesis that the norms and institutions that compose the modern package of monogamous marriage have been favoured by cultural evolution because of their group-beneficial effects—promoting success in inter-group competition. In suppressing intrasexual competition and reducing the size of the pool of unmarried men, normative monogamy reduces crime rates, including rape, murder, assault, robbery and fraud, as well as decreasing personal abuses. By assuaging the competition for younger brides, normative monogamy decreases (i) the spousal age gap, (ii) fertility, and (iii) gender inequality. By shifting male efforts from seeking wives to paternal investment, normative monogamy increases savings, child investment and economic productivity. By increasing the relatedness within households, normative monogamy reduces intra-household conflict, leading to lower rates of child neglect, abuse, accidental death and homicide. These predictions are tested using converging lines of evidence from across the human sciences.},

It is argued that the {DS} framework provides a more rigorous set of principles that can be applied to the diverse disciplines and multiple levels of analyses that are so well-represented in developmental psychopathology. The ways in which {DS} principles can address five overarching goals that have previously been identified for the field of developmental psychopathology are discussed. In addition, the {DS} approach offers a wide array of methodological tools that can move the field from abstractions to concrete research designs and analytic strategies. Several of the most relevant {DS} concepts are explained and recent empirical studies that have applied these concepts fruitfully are reviewed.},

The measure demonstrated satisfactory reliability and preliminary construct validity. The study of a subset of items controlling for same-sex versus cross-sex stimulus figures provided the basis for investigating developmental aspects of empathic arousal toward peers of different sexes.

The earliest {ERP} correlate of visual consciousness appears over posterior visual cortex around 100–200 ms after stimulus onset. Its scalp topography and time window are consistent with recurrent processing in the visual cortex. This electrophysiological correlate of visual consciousness is mostly independent of later {ERPs} reflecting selective attention and working memory functions. Overall, the {ERP} evidence supports the view that phenomenal consciousness of a visual stimulus emerges earlier than access consciousness, and that attention and awareness are served by distinct neural processes.},

It is argued that a mathematization of natural phenomena never happens by itself. First, appropriate key concepts must be found that are intimately connected with the phenomena one wishes to describe and explain mathematically. Second, the scale on, and not beyond, which a specific description can hold must be specified. Different scales allow for different conceptual and mathematical descriptions. This is the scaling hypothesis. Third, can a mathematical description be universally valid and, if so, how? Here we put forth the argument that universals also exist in theoretical neuroscience, that evolution proves the rule, and that theoretical neuroscience is a domain with still lots of space for new developments initiated by an intensive interaction with experiment. Finally, major insight is provided by a careful analysis of the way in which particular brain structures respond to perceptual input and in so doing induce action in an animal’s surroundings.},

The results of previous reports about family-based association studies between the serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) gene promoter polymorphism and autism are controversial. In this study, an analysis using the transmission/disequilibrium test ({TDT}) between the 5-{HTT} gene promoter polymorphism and autism in 104 trios, all ethnically Japanese, showed no significant linkage disequilibrium (P=0.17). Recently, it has been reported that some haplotypes at the serotonin transporter locus may be associated with the pathogenesis of autism. Therefore, further investigations by haplotype analyses are necessary to confirm the implications of genetic variants of the serotonin transporter in the etiology of autism.},

Researchers armed only with sample sizes and test results of the published findings can correct for publication bias. We validate the technique with simulations and by reanalyzing data from the Many-Labs Replication project.

	abstract = {The mirror neuron system ({MNS}) is considered crucial for human imitation and language learning and provides the basis for the development of empathy and mentalizing. Alexithymia ({ALEX}), which refers to deficiencies in the self-awareness of emotional states, has been reported to be associated with poor ability in various aspects of social cognition such as mentalizing, cognitive empathy, and perspective-taking. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), we measured the hemodynamic signal to examine whether there are functional differences in the {MNS} activity between participants with {ALEX} (n = 16) and without {ALEX} (n = 13), in response to a classic {MNS} task (i.e., the observation of video clips depicting goal-directed hand movements). Both groups showed increased neural activity in the premotor and the parietal cortices during observation of hand actions. However, activation was greater for the {ALEX} group than the non-{ALEX} group. Furthermore, activation in the left premotor area was negatively correlated with perspective-taking ability as assessed with the interpersonal reactivity index. The signal in parietal cortices was negatively correlated with cognitive facets assessed by the stress coping inventory and positively correlated with the neuroticism scale from the {NEO} five factor personality scale. In addition, in the {ALEX} group, activation in the right superior parietal region showed a positive correlation with the severity of {ALEX} as measured by a structured interview. These results suggest that the stronger {MNS}-related neural response in individuals scoring high on {ALEX} is associated with their insufficient self-other differentiation.

Expression assays in 62 lymphoblastoid cell lines representing the six genotypes and in transfected raphe-derived cells showed codominant allele action and low, nearly equivalent expression for the S and {LG} alleles, accounting for more variation in {HTT} expression than previously recognized. The gain-of-function {LALA} genotype was approximately twice as common in 169 whites with obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}) than in 253 ethnically matched controls. We performed a replication study in 175 trios consisting of probands with {OCD} and their parents. The {LA} allele was twofold overtransmitted to the patients with {OCD}. The {HTTLPR} {LALA} genotype exerts a moderate (1.8-fold) effect on risk of {OCD}, which crystallizes the evidence that the {HTT} gene has a role in {OCD}.},

	abstract = {Objective. —This article defines stress and related concepts and reviews their historical development. The notion of a stress system as the effector of the stress syndrome is suggested, and its physiologic and pathophysiologic manifestations are described. A new perspective on human disease states associated with dysregulation of the stress system is provided.Data Sources. —Published original articles from human and animal studies and selected reviews. Literature was surveyed utilizing {MEDLINE} and the Index Medicus.Study Selection. —Original articles from the basic science and human literature consisted entirely of controlled studies based on verified methodologies and, with the exception of the most recent studies, replicated by more than one laboratory. Many of the basic science and clinical studies had been conducted in our own laboratories and clinical research units. Reviews cited were written by acknowledged leaders in the fields of neurobiology, endocrinology, and behavior.Data Extraction. —Independent extraction and cross-referencing by the authors.Data Synthesis. —Stress and related concepts can be traced as far back as written science and medicine. The stress system coordinates the generalized stress response, which takes place when a stressor of any kind exceeds a threshold. The main components of the stress system are the corticotropin-releasing hormone and locus ceruleus-norepinephrine/autonomic systems and their peripheral effectors, the pituitary-adrenal axis, and the limbs of the autonomic system. Activation of the stress system leads to behavioral and peripheral changes that improve the ability of the organism to adjust homeostasis and increase its chances for survival. There has been an exponential increase in knowledge regarding the interactions among the components of the stress system and between the stress system and other brain elements involved in the regulation of emotion, cognitive function, and behavior, as well as with the axes responsible for reproduction, growth, and immunity. This new knowledge has allowed association of stress system dysfunction, characterized by sustained hyperactivity and/or hypoactivity, to various pathophysiologic states that cut across the traditional boundaries of medical disciplines. These include a range of psychiatric, endocrine, and inflammatory disorders and/or susceptibility to such disorders.Conclusions. —We hope that knowledge from apparently disparate fields of science and medicine integrated into a working theoretical framework will allow generation and testing of new hypotheses on the pathophysiology and diagnosis of, and therapy for, a variety of human illnesses reflecting systematic alterations in the principal effectors of the generalized stress response. We predict that pharmacologic agents capable of altering the central apparatus that governs the stress response will be useful in the treatment of many of these illnesses.({JAMA}. 1992;267:1244-1252)},

The current study directly compared the results of the ‘false belief’ and ‘self’ tasks in individual subjects. Consistent with previous reports, the medial prefrontal and medial precuneus regions recruited by the two tasks significantly overlap in individual subjects, although there was also evidence for non-overlapping voxels in medial regions. The temporo-parietal regions are only recruited for the ‘theory of mind’ task.

Moreover, data from 16 countries reveals that people dramatically underestimate actual pay inequality. In the United States—where underestimation was particularly pronounced—the actual pay ratio of {CEOs} to unskilled workers (354:1) far exceeded the estimated ratio (30:1), which in turn far exceeded the ideal ratio (7:1).

	abstract = {We assessed electrophysiological activity over the medial frontal cortex ({MFC}) during outcome-based behavioral adjustment using a probabilistic reversal learning task. During recording, participants were presented two abstract visual patterns on each trial and had to select the stimulus rewarded on 80\% of trials and to avoid the stimulus rewarded on 20\% of trials. These contingencies were reversed frequently during the experiment. Previous {EEG} work has revealed feedback-locked electrophysiological responses over the {MFC} (feedback-related negativity; {FRN}), which correlate with the negative prediction error [Holroyd, C. B., \& Coles, M. G. The neural basis of human error processing: Reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity. Psychological Review, 109, 679–709, 2002] and which predict outcome-based adjustment of decision values [Cohen, M. X., \& Ranganath, C. Reinforcement learning signals predict future decisions. Journal of Neuroscience, 27, 371–378, 2007]. Unlike previous paradigms, our paradigm enabled us to disentangle, on the one hand, mechanisms related to the reward prediction error, derived from reinforcement learning ({RL}) modeling, and on the other hand, mechanisms related to explicit rule-based adjustment of actual behavior. Our results demonstrate greater {FRN} amplitudes with greater {RL} model-derived prediction errors. Conversely expected negative outcomes that preceded rule-based behavioral reversal were not accompanied by an {FRN}. This pattern contrasted remarkably with that of the P3 amplitude, which was significantly greater for expected negative outcomes that preceded rule-based behavioral reversal than for unexpected negative outcomes that did not precede behavioral reversal. These data suggest that the {FRN} reflects prediction error and associated {RL}-based adjustment of decision values, whereas the P3 reflects adjustment of behavior on the basis of explicit rules.},

The method of assessing empathy did influence the strength of the relation; picture/story measures of empathy were not associated with prosocial behavior, whereas nearly all other measures were.

	abstract = {Aversive emotional reactions to real or imagined social harms infuse moral judgment and motivate prosocial behavior. Here, we show that the neurotransmitter serotonin directly alters both moral judgment and behavior through increasing subjects’ aversion to personally harming others. We enhanced serotonin in healthy volunteers with citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and contrasted its effects with both a pharmacological control treatment and a placebo on tests of moral judgment and behavior. We measured the drugs' effects on moral judgment in a set of moral 'dilemmas' pitting utilitarian outcomes (e.g., saving five lives) against highly aversive harmful actions (e.g., killing an innocent person). Enhancing serotonin made subjects more likely to judge harmful actions as forbidden, but only in cases where harms were emotionally salient. This harm-avoidant bias after citalopram was also evident in behavior during the ultimatum game, in which subjects decide to accept or reject fair or unfair monetary offers from another player. Rejecting unfair offers enforces a fairness norm but also harms the other player financially. Enhancing serotonin made subjects less likely to reject unfair offers. Furthermore, the prosocial effects of citalopram varied as a function of trait empathy. Individuals high in trait empathy showed stronger effects of citalopram on moral judgment and behavior than individuals low in trait empathy. Together, these findings provide unique evidence that serotonin could promote prosocial behavior by enhancing harm aversion, a prosocial sentiment that directly affects both moral judgment and moral behavior.},

Forty-nine of these children displayed symptoms of aggressive/destructive (externalizing) problems that were in the borderline clinical range (labelled “high risk”) and 50 children displayed few such symptoms (“low risk”). The children were assessed in a series of laboratory procedures that were intended to be emotionally and behaviorally challenging, during which time heart rate was recorded and behavior was observed. To assess physiological regulation, resting measures of heart period and respiratory sinus arrythmia ({RSA}), and heart period change and {RSA} suppression were derived from these procedures. To assess emotional and behavioral regulation, children's affect and on-task versus types of off-task behaviors were measured. Results indicated that children in the high-risk group did not differ from children in the low-risk group on the resting measure of heart period. Boys displayed lower heart rate than did girls, regardless of risk group. However, boys in the low-risk group differed from boys in the high-risk group in terms of resting measures of {RSA}. Children in the high-risk group did display significantly and consistently lower {RSA} suppression (physiological regulation) during the challenging situations than did the children in the low-risk group. High-risk children displayed more negative affect and dysregulated emotion regulation behaviors than did the low risk children. These findings are discussed in terms of the development of behavioral and emotional regulation that underlie adaptive versus maladaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}. The objective of this study was to describe overnight polysomnographic measures in normal children aged 3 to 7 years. We conducted a retrospective analysis of normal polysomnographic evaluations from participants in 2 large community-based studies of sleep-disordered breathing among preschoolers and early school-aged children at Kosair Children's Hospital Sleep Medicine Research Center at the University of Louisville. Participants included 542 healthy children with ages ranging from 3.2 to 8.6 years. {RESULTS}. Subjects were excluded from analysis if they had documented snoring during polysomnography, an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index of [≥]1.0, or a periodic leg-movement index of [≥]5.0. Because the greatest differences in polysomnography occurred between ages 5 and 6 years, analyses were performed for children 3 to 5 years and for ages [≥]6. Sleep cyclicity was distinct between age groups, with both showing an initial brief rapid-eye-movement period, which lengthened across the night, but only the older group showing a decrease in cycle length across the night. Average obstructive apnea indices were 0.03 per hour of total sleep time ({TST}) for 3- to 5-year-old children and 0.05 per hour of {TST} for [≥]6-year-old children, whereas central apnea indices were 0.82 and 0.45 per hour of {TST}, respectively. Older children spent a greater percentage of sleep time supine, and the apnea-hypopnea index differed according to body position. Twenty percent of all subjects had end tidal carbon dioxide values of {\textgreater}45 mm Hg, and 2.2\% had recorded values {\textgreater}50 mm Hg during [≥]50\% {TST}. High variance was present on all measures. {CONCLUSIONS}. Developmental changes occur in several polysomnographic measures among normal children from 3 to 7 years of age, particularly during transition from preschool to early school age. Our findings in a large number of healthy community children comprise the most extensive compilation of normative reference values for laboratory-based pediatric polysomnography to date.},

In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of ‘is there information about a variable of interest’ (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely ‘where is the information’ (pattern localization) and ‘how is that information encoded’ (pattern characterization).},

	abstract = {The hippocampus is the principal target site in the brain for adrenocortical steroids, as it has the highest concentration of receptor sites for glucocorticoids. The aged rat has a specific deficit in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors, owing in large part to a loss of corticoid-sensitive neurons. This deficit may be the cause for the failure of aged rats to terminate corticosterone secretion at the end of stress, because extensive lesion and electrical stimulation studies have shown that the hippocampus exerts an inhibitory influence over adrenocortical activity and participates in glucocorticoid feedback. We have studied whether it is the loss of hippocampal neurons or of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors in the aged rat that contributes most to this syndrome of corticosterone hypersecretion. To do this, we used two model systems for producing reversible glucocorticoid receptor depletion in the hippocampus, and we found that depletion of receptors without inducing cell loss results in corticosterone hypersecretion. Furthermore, correction of the receptor deficit results in normalization of corticosterone secretion. These results focus attention on the hippocampus as an important glucocorticoid sensor in relation to the stress response. They also provide important new physiological correlates for the remarkable plasticity of the hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor system, which is under independent control by corticosterone and by vasopressin.},

We examined how life satisfaction and personality traits are geographically distributed within the {UK} London metropolitan area, and how the strength of associations between personality traits and life satisfaction vary by residential location (i.e., personality–neighborhood interactions). Residential area was recorded at the level of postal districts (216 districts, n = 56,019 participants). Results indicated that the strength of associations between personality traits and life satisfaction depended on neighborhood characteristics. Higher openness to experience was more positively associated with life satisfaction in postal districts characterized by higher average openness to experience, population density, and ethnic diversity. Higher agreeableness and conscientiousness were more strongly associated with life satisfaction in postal districts with lower overall levels of life satisfaction. The associations of extraversion and emotional stability were not modified by neighborhood characteristics. These findings suggest that people’s life satisfaction depends, in part, on the interaction between individual personality and particular features of the places they live.},

	abstract = {Classic minimal-group studies found that people arbitrarily assigned to a novel group quickly display a range of perceptual, affective, and behavioral in-group biases. We randomly assigned participants to a mixed-race team and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain regions involved in processing novel in-group and out-group members independently of preexisting attitudes, stereotypes, or familiarity. Whereas previous research on intergroup perception found amygdala activity—typically interpreted as negativity—in response to stigmatized social groups, we found greater activity in the amygdala, fusiform gyri, orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsal striatum when participants viewed novel in-group faces than when they viewed novel out-group faces. Moreover, activity in orbitofrontal cortex mediated the in-group bias in self-reported liking for the faces. These in-group biases in neural activity were not moderated by race or by whether participants explicitly attended to team membership or race, a finding suggesting that they may occur automatically. This study helps clarify the role of neural substrates involved in perceptual and affective in-group biases.},

The review incorporates a meta-analysis of 19 studies on emotion recognition and understanding in this population. This showed an overall negative effect of maltreatment, but moderation analyses revealed that significantly stronger effects were found for measures of emotion understanding rather than recognition, and for younger rather than older age groups. The broader review also reveals a complex and differentiated profile of social understanding among maltreated children. Directions for future research that addresses individual differences in children’s experiences, both within and outside the maltreatment context, are discussed.},

Abdominal pain was noted by 75\% of all students. The pain occurred weekly in 13\% to 17\% of the subjects and was severe enough to affect activities in approximately 21\%. Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms were noted by 17\% of high school students and 8\% of middle school students (p {\textless}0.01) who reported abdominal pain (n = 381), representing 14\% and 6\% of all high school and middle school students (p {\textless}0.005), respectively. Anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher for students with {IBS}-type symptoms compared with those without symptoms. Eight percent of all students had seen a physician for abdominal pain in the previous year. These visits were correlated with abdominal pain severity, frequency, duration, and disruption of normal activities but not with anxiety, depression, gender, family structure, or ethnicity. {CONCLUSION}: Recurrent abdominal pain and symptoms of {IBS} are commonly noted in a community-based adolescent population and frequently result in use of health care resources. Health care providers who work with this age group need to be able to recognize the symptom complex associated with {IBS}, as well as the possible relationship to anxiety and depression.

Unfair offers were equally often rejected in both conditions. Neuroimaging data revealed a dissociation between the medial prefrontal cortex, specifically associated with rejections in the myself condition, thus confirming its role in self-related emotional responses, and the left anterior insula, associated with rejections in both myself and third-party conditions, suggesting a role in promoting fair behavior also toward third parties.

	abstract = {The brain is the key organ of the response to stress because it determines what is threatening and, therefore, potentially stressful, as well as the physiological and behavioral responses which can be either adaptive or damaging. Stress involves two-way communication between the brain and the cardiovascular, immune, and other systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms. Beyond the "flight-or-fight" response to acute stress, there are events in daily life that produce a type of chronic stress and lead over time to wear and tear on the body ("allostatic load"). Yet, hormones associated with stress protect the body in the short-run and promote adaptation ("allostasis"). The brain is a target of stress, and the hippocampus was the first brain region, besides the hypothalamus, to be recognized as a target of glucocorticoids. Stress and stress hormones produce both adaptive and maladaptive effects on this brain region throughout the life course. Early life events influence life-long patterns of emotionality and stress responsiveness and alter the rate of brain and body aging. The hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex undergo stress-induced structural remodeling, which alters behavioral and physiological responses. As an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy, social and behavioral interventions such as regular physical activity and social support reduce the chronic stress burden and benefit brain and body health and resilience.},

	abstract = {Affective and cognitive empathy are traditionally differentiated, the affective component being concerned with resonating with another’s emotional state, whereas the cognitive component reflects regulation of the resulting distress and understanding of another’s mental states (see Decety and Jackson, 2004 for a review). Adolescence is a critical period for the development of cognitive control processes necessary to regulate affective processes: it is only in young adulthood that these control processes achieve maturity (Steinberg, 2005). Thus, one should expect adolescents to show greater automatic empathy than young adults. The present study aimed at exploring the neural correlates of affective (automatic) and cognitive empathy for pain from adolescence to young adulthood. With this aim, Event Related Potentials ({ERPs}) were recorded in 32 participants (aged 11–39) in a task designed to dissociate these components. {ERPs} results showed an early automatic fronto-central response to pain (that was not modulated by task demand) and a late parietal response to painful stimuli modulated by attention to pain cues. Adolescents exhibited earlier automatic responses to painful situations than young adults did and showed greater activity in the late cognitive component even when viewing neutral stimuli. Results are discussed in the context of the development of regulatory abilities during adolescence.},

Method: The study used a forced titration, open label design, with genotype blind until study completion. Participants were children and adolescents aged 4-17 years of age with a confirmed {ASD} (autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified). Results: There was an interaction between genotype group and time on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist ({ABC}) Irritability Subscale (primary outcome variable) (linear maximum marginal likelihood estimation=-4.84, Z=-2.89, {SE}=1.67, P=0.004). Examination of baseline to last visit revealed that a genotype grouping based on a previous study of platelet 5-{HT} uptake revealed less response in the genotype group that had S/S genotype for 5-{HTTLPR} and did not have a diplotype in intron 1 previously shown to be associated with increased platelet 5-{HT} uptake. Conclusion: This genotype-blind, prospective pharmacogenetic study found the group of subjects with associated with the lowest platelet 5-{HT} uptake from previous study had the smallest reduction in {ABC}-Irritability scores after open label treatment with escitalopram. Replication is necessary to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {The high energetic costs of human brain development have been hypothesized to explain distinctive human traits, including exceptionally slow and protracted preadult growth. Although widely assumed to constrain life-history evolution, the metabolic requirements of the growing human brain are unknown. We combined previously collected {PET} and {MRI} data to calculate the human brain’s glucose use from birth to adulthood, which we compare with body growth rate. We evaluate the strength of brain–body metabolic trade-offs using the ratios of brain glucose uptake to the body’s resting metabolic rate ({RMR}) and daily energy requirements ({DER}) expressed in glucose-gram equivalents (glucosermr\% and glucoseder\%). We find that glucosermr\% and glucoseder\% do not peak at birth (52.5\% and 59.8\% of {RMR}, or 35.4\% and 38.7\% of {DER}, for males and females, respectively), when relative brain size is largest, but rather in childhood (66.3\% and 65.0\% of {RMR} and 43.3\% and 43.8\% of {DER}). Body-weight growth (dw/dt) and both glucosermr\% and glucoseder\% are strongly, inversely related: soon after birth, increases in brain glucose demand are accompanied by proportionate decreases in dw/dt. Ages of peak brain glucose demand and lowest dw/dt co-occur and subsequent developmental declines in brain metabolism are matched by proportionate increases in dw/dt until puberty. The finding that human brain glucose demands peak during childhood, and evidence that brain metabolism and body growth rate covary inversely across development, support the hypothesis that the high costs of human brain development require compensatory slowing of body growth rate.},

Using {MKDA}, a whole-brain based quantitative meta-analysis of recent {fMRI} studies of empathy was performed. This analysis identified the {dACC}-{aMCC}-{SMA} and bilateral anterior insula as being consistently activated in empathy. Hypothesizing that what are here termed affective–perceptual and cognitive–evaluative forms of empathy might be characterized by different activity patterns, the neural activations in these forms of empathy were compared. The dorsal {aMCC} was demonstrated to be recruited more frequently in the cognitive–evaluative form of empathy, whilst the right anterior insula was found to be involved in the affective–perceptual form of empathy only. The left anterior insula was active in both forms of empathy. It was concluded that the {dACC}-{aMCC}-{SMA} and bilateral insula can be considered as forming a core network in empathy, and that cognitive–evaluative and affective–perceptual empathy can be distinguished at the level of regional activation.},

Further discussion considers the personal source of behavioral invariance, the situational source of behavioral variation, the person–situation interaction, the nature of behavior, and the “personality triad” of persons, situations, and behaviors, in which each element is understood and predicted in terms of the other two. An important goal for future research is further development of theories and methods for conceptualizing and measuring the functional aspects of situations and of behaviors. One reason for the persistence of the person situation debate may be that it serves as a proxy for a deeper, implicit debate over values such as equality vs. individuality, determinism vs. free will, and flexibility vs. consistency. However, these value dichotomies may be as false as the person–situation debate that they implicitly drive.},

We tested two {FKBP}5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1360780 and rs3800373) in a sample of 246 geriatric patients treated for 8 weeks in a double-blind randomized comparison trial of paroxetine and mirtazapine. These two polymorphisms had previously been reported to predict efficacy in depressed patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine, and those treated with mirtazapine, an agent with both serotonergic and noradrenergic actions. However, we found no significant associations between these {FKBP}5 genetic variants and clinical outcomes. Neither mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores nor time to remission or response were predicted by {FKBP}5 genetic variation.

However, these aspects of brain development have rarely been investigated concurrently in the same sample and hence the relations between them are not understood. We delineated the age-related changes in cortical thickness, regional {WM} volume, and diffusion characteristics and investigated the relationships between these properties of brain development. One hundred and sixty-eight healthy participants aged 8–30 years underwent {sMRI} and {DTI}. The results showed regional age-related cortical thinning, {WM} volume increases, and changes in diffusion parameters. Cortical thickness was the most strongly age-related parameter. All classes of measures showed unique associations with age. The results indicate that cortical thinning in adolescence cannot be explained by {WM} maturation in underlying regions as measured by volumetry or {DTI}. Moderate associations between cortical thickness and both volume and diffusion parameters in underlying {WM} regions were also found, although the relationships were not strong. It is concluded that none of the measures are redundant and that the integration of the 3 will yield a more complete understanding of brain maturation.},

	abstract = {Sleep deprivation is commonplace in modern society, but its far-reaching effects on cognitive performance are only beginning to be understood from a scientific perspective. While there is broad consensus that insufficient sleep leads to a general slowing of response speed and increased variability in performance, particularly for simple measures of alertness, attention and vigilance, there is much less agreement about the effects of sleep deprivation on many higher level cognitive capacities, including perception, memory and executive functions. Central to this debate has been the question of whether sleep deprivation affects nearly all cognitive capacities in a global manner through degraded alertness and attention, or whether sleep loss specifically impairs some aspects of cognition more than others. Neuroimaging evidence has implicated the prefrontal cortex as a brain region that may be particularly susceptible to the effects of sleep loss, but perplexingly, executive function tasks that putatively measure prefrontal functioning have yielded inconsistent findings within the context of sleep deprivation. Whereas many convergent and rule-based reasoning, decision making and planning tasks are relatively unaffected by sleep loss, more creative, divergent and innovative aspects of cognition do appear to be degraded by lack of sleep. Emerging evidence suggests that some aspects of higher level cognitive capacities remain degraded by sleep deprivation despite restoration of alertness and vigilance with stimulant countermeasures, suggesting that sleep loss may affect specific cognitive systems above and beyond the effects produced by global cognitive declines or impaired attentional processes. Finally, the role of emotion as a critical facet of cognition has received increasing attention in recent years and mounting evidence suggests that sleep deprivation may particularly affect cognitive systems that rely on emotional data. Thus, the extent to which sleep deprivation affects a particular cognitive process may depend on several factors, including the magnitude of global decline in general alertness and attention, the degree to which the specific cognitive function depends on emotion-processing networks, and the extent to which that cognitive process can draw upon associated cortical regions for compensatory support.},

However, most {SRM} studies have employed short adjective scales instead of personality questionnaires. Results based on the {HEXACO}-{PI}-R in family and work groups showed high levels of consensus (target variance) and self-other agreement for all traits and, except for Honesty–Humility and Openness to Experience, low levels of generalized rater bias (perceiver variance) and of assumed similarity. Additionally, intraclass correlations suggested a 'group personality' for some traits. The findings suggest that the use of personality questionnaires in Social Relations Analyses may promote higher estimates of consensus in personality judgments.

Previous research documented that the combined dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone ({DEX}/{CRH}) test identifies {HPA} dysfunction with high sensitivity. We evaluated the predictive validity for medium-term outcome of the cortisol response in the combined {DEX}/{CRH} test in 74 remitted patients previously suffering from major depressive disorder. Of the 74 patients, 61 remained in stable remission and 13 relapsed during the first 6 months after discharge from the hospital. Although the cortisol and {ACTH} responses in the {DEX}/{CRH} test did not differ between the two groups of patients on admission, the responses differed significantly just before discharge (P\&lt; 0.05). We defined two dichotomous variables as prediction rules indicating (1) the change between admission and discharge in the cortisol response to the {DEX}/{CRH} test, and (2) the effect of the {CRH} infusion on cortisol as compared to the baseline level in the {DEX}/{CRH} test prior to discharge only. An elevated cortisol response in the {DEX}/{CRH} test was correlated with a four- to six-fold higher risk for relapse than in individuals with a normal cortisol response. The two proposed rules for predicting relapse within the first 6 months after discharge could be optimized by including age and gender. Hence, an exaggerated cortisol response in the combined {DEX}/{CRH} test predicts the recurrence of depressive psychopathology. The test performance can be further optimized if gender and age are taken into account.},

	abstract = {The ability to empathize with the suffering of others is critical for maintaining relationships and engaging in prosocial behavior. Recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that while watching other people experience pain (other pain), participants engage the anterior insula ({AI}) and anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), brain regions involved in the direct experience of pain (self pain). Here we test the hypothesis that common activity in {ACC} and {AI} may reflect the operation of distinct but overlapping networks of regions that support perception of self or other pain. To address this possibility, we scanned participants using {fMRI} while they received noxious thermal stimulation (self pain) or watched short videos of other people sustaining painful injuries (other pain). We isolated overlapping regions for self and other pain in the {ACC} and {AI} and then used them as seed regions for two kinds of functional connectivity analyses. These analyses identified areas whose activity co-varied with {ACC} and {AI} activity during self or other pain either across time (intra-individual connectivity) or across participants (inter-individual connectivity). Both connectivity analyses identified clusters in the midbrain and periaqueductal gray with greater connectivity to the {AI} during self pain as opposed to other pain. The opposite pattern was found in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, that showed greater connectivity to the {ACC} and {AI} during other pain than during self pain using both types of analysis. Intra-individual connectivity analyses also revealed regions in the superior temporal sulcus, posterior cingulate, and precuneus that became more connected to {ACC} during other pain as compared to self pain. Together, these data demonstrated that regions showing similar activity during self and other pain may nonetheless be part of distinct functional networks. These networks could not have been detected in prior work that examined overlap between self and other pain in terms of average activity, but not connectivity.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studiesofemotion, personality, and social cognition have drawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high (e.g., {\textgreater}.8) correlations between brain activation and personality measures. We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both {fMRI} and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in {fMRI} research of many kinds—not just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.},

	abstract = {Understanding the minds of others is one of the great challenges humans face. Accordingly, much work in cognitive neuroscience has explored the brain systems engaged when perceivers share and make inferences about the internal states of social targets. These studies, however, typically use divergent and highly simplified stimuli and methods and as a consequence have produced largely non-overlapping sets of results and artificially constrained theories about the processes involved in perceivers’ abilities to understand targets. Here we suggest that these difficulties may stem from two main sources: the lack of meaningful behavioral data about the brain bases of perceivers’ accuracy in inferring target states and qualitative differences between the social stimuli used in neuroimaging paradigms and the social information perceivers encounter in the real world. We advocate more focus on studies of naturalistic social cognition, which could overcome these limitations and complement current approaches, and discuss work in our laboratory that has demonstrated the feasibility and utility of such a focus. Finally, we discuss the relevance of naturalistic social cognition to diagnosing and treating autism spectrum disorder. Overall, using naturalistic paradigms in neuroimaging will be critical to modeling the way the brain actually understands other minds.},

Mental simulation may also be a representational tool to understand the self and others. However, successfully navigating these shared representations – both within oneself and between individuals – constitutes an essential functional property of any autonomous agent. It will be argued that self-awareness and agency, mediated by the temporoparietal ({TPJ}) area and the prefrontal cortex, are critical aspects of the social mind. Thus, differences as well as similarities between self and other representations at the neural level may be related to the degrees of self-awareness and agency.

Participants also preferred greater social distance from affective deviants, reported more moral outrage in response to them, and inferred that these targets did not share their moral values. Incongruent affect resulted in more negative social judgment than did flat affect, and this relationship was moderated by stimulus valence. Finally, the relationship between targets’ affective expressions and participants’ avoidant intentions was mediated by the extent to which participants thought the targets shared their moral values.

	abstract = {The overall goal of this work is to demonstrate how resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) signals may be used to objectively parcellate functionally heterogeneous subregions of the human amygdala into structures characterized by similar patterns of functional connectivity. We hypothesize that similarity of functional connectivity of subregions with other parts of the brain can be a potential basis to segment and cluster voxels using data driven approaches. In this work, self-organizing map ({SOM}) was implemented to cluster the connectivity maps associated with each voxel of the human amygdala, thereby defining distinct subregions. The functional separation was optimized by evaluating the overall differences in functional connectivity between the subregions at group level. Analysis of 25 resting state {fMRI} data sets suggests that {SOM} can successfully identify functionally independent nuclei based on differences in their inter subregional functional connectivity, evaluated statistically at various confidence levels. Although amygdala contains several nuclei whose distinct roles are implicated in various functions, our objective approach discerns at least two functionally distinct volumes comparable to previous parcellation results obtained using probabilistic tractography and cytoarchitectonic analysis. Association of these nuclei with various known functions and a quantitative evaluation of their differences in overall functional connectivity with lateral orbital frontal cortex and temporal pole confirms the functional diversity of amygdala. The data driven approach adopted here may be used as a powerful indicator of structure–function relationships in the amygdala and other functionally heterogeneous structures as well.

	abstract = {Background  
    Mood-congruent processing biases are among the most robust research findings in neuropsychological studies of depression. Depressed patients show preferential processing of negatively toned stimuli across a range of cognitive tasks. The present study aimed to determine whether these behavioral abnormalities are associated with specific neural substrates.Methods  
    Ten depressed patients and 11 healthy control subjects underwent scanning during performance of an emotional go/no-go task using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The task allowed comparison among neural response to happy, sad, and neutral words, in the context of these words as targets (ie, stimuli to which subjects were required to make a motor response) or distractors (ie, stimuli to which the motor response was withheld).Results  
    Depressed patients showed attenuated neural responses to emotional relative to neutral targets in ventral cingulate and posterior orbitofrontal cortices. However, patients showed elevated responses specific to sad targets in rostral anterior cingulate extending to anterior medial prefrontal cortex. Unlike controls, patients showed differential neural response to emotional, particularly sad, distractors in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex.Conclusions  
    These findings suggest a distinct neural substrate for mood-congruent processing biases in performance. The medial and orbital prefrontal regions may play a key role in mediating the interaction between mood and cognition in affective disorder.},

	abstract = {Thalamic alterations have been reported in autism, but the relationships between these abnormalities and clinical symptoms, specifically sensory features, have not been elucidated. The goal of this investigation is to combine two neuroimaging methods to examine further the pathophysiology of thalamic anomalies in autism and to identify any association with sensory deficits. Structural {MRI} and multi-voxel, short echo-time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H {MRS}) measurements were collected from 18 male children with autism and 16 healthy children. Anatomical measurements of thalamic nuclei and absolute concentration levels of key 1H {MRS} metabolites were obtained. Sensory abnormalities were assessed using a sensory profile questionnaire. Lower levels of N-acetylaspartate ({NAA}), phosphocreatine and creatine, and choline-containing metabolites were observed on the left side in the autism group compared with controls. No differences in thalamic volumes were observed between the two groups. Relationships, although limited, were observed between measures of sensory abnormalities and 1H {MRS} metabolites. Findings from this study support the role of the thalamus in the pathophysiology of autism and more specifically in the sensory abnormalities observed in this disorder. Further investigations of this structure are warranted, since it plays an important role in information processing as part of the cortico–thalamo–cortical pathways.},

Socially anxious individuals are excessively concerned about negative evaluation by others. One might therefore predict that high social anxiety would be associated with selective attention to negative facial expressions. On the other hand, some recent models have suggested that social anxiety may be associated with reduced processing of external social cues. A modified dot-probe task was used to investigate face attention. High and low socially anxious individuals were presented with pairs of pictures, consisting of a face (positive, neutral, or negative) and a household object, under conditions of social-evaluative threat or no threat. The results indicated that, compared to low socially anxious individuals, high socially anxious individuals show an attentional bias away from emotional (positive and negative) faces but this effect is only observed under conditions of social-evaluative threat.

Clear age differences were found: when adolescents get older, friends become more important for whether they volunteer, and the family's civic orientation becomes important for their volunteering frequency.

We compared the association of the standard {DST} and the combined dexamethasone/cortico-tropin-releasing hormone ({DEX}/{CRH}) challenge with parameters of diurnal Cortisol profiles.

Methods: We performed a {DEX}/{CRH} challenge and 24-hour Cortisol profiles in 25 depressed patients (mean age: 47.4 Â± 16.0 years) and 33 age-matched healthy controls (mean age: 51.4 Â± 19.3 years).

Results: A path analysis showed Cortisol area under the curve ({AUC}) after {CRH} (= {DEX}/{CRH} status) to be dependent upon minimal 24-hour Cortisol and evening frequency of pulsatile Cortisol release. In contrast, post-dexamethasone Cortisol (= {DST} status) was related to 24-hour mean Cortisol. Simple linear regressions supported an association of Cortisol {AUC} with several parameters of the diurnal Cortisol profiles, which was not true for the standard {DST}.

Conclusions: We conclude that the combined {DEX}/{CRH} challenge test is more closely associated with the activity of the {HPA} system than the standard {DST} in healthy and depressed subjects.},

	doi = {10.1542/peds.113.5.e472},
	abstract = {Autism is a complex, behaviorally defined, static disorder of the immature brain that is of great concern to the practicing pediatrician because of an astonishing 556\% reported increase in pediatric prevalence between 1991 and 1997, to a prevalence higher than that of spina bifida, cancer, or Down syndrome. This jump is probably attributable to heightened awareness and changing diagnostic criteria rather than to new environmental influences. Autism is not a disease but a syndrome with multiple nongenetic and genetic causes. By autism (the autistic spectrum disorders [{ASDs}]), we mean the wide spectrum of developmental disorders characterized by impairments in 3 behavioral domains: 1) social interaction; 2) language, communication, and imaginative play; and 3) range of interests and activities. Autism corresponds in this article to pervasive developmental disorder ({PDD}) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Except for Rett syndrome--attributable in most affected individuals to mutations of the methyl-{CpG}-binding protein 2 ({MeCP}2) gene--the other {PDD} subtypes (autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, disintegrative disorder, and {PDD} Not Otherwise Specified [{PDD}-{NOS}]) are not linked to any particular genetic or nongenetic cause. Review of 2 major textbooks on autism and of papers published between 1961 and 2003 yields convincing evidence for multiple interacting genetic factors as the main causative determinants of autism. Epidemiologic studies indicate that environmental factors such as toxic exposures, teratogens, perinatal insults, and prenatal infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus account for few cases. These studies fail to confirm that immunizations with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine are responsible for the surge in autism. Epilepsy, the medical condition most highly associated with autism, has equally complex genetic/nongenetic (but mostly unknown) causes. Autism is frequent in tuberous sclerosis complex and fragile X syndrome, but these 2 disorders account for but a small minority of cases. Currently, diagnosable medical conditions, cytogenetic abnormalities, and single-gene defects (eg, tuberous sclerosis complex, fragile X syndrome, and other rare diseases) together account for {\textless}10\% of cases. There is convincing evidence that "idiopathic" autism is a heritable disorder. Epidemiologic studies report an {ASD} prevalence of [{\textasciitilde}]3 to 6/1000, with a male to female ratio of 3:1. This skewed ratio remains unexplained: despite the contribution of a few well characterized X-linked disorders, male-to-male transmission in a number of families rules out X-linkage as the prevailing mode of inheritance. The recurrence rate in siblings of affected children is [{\textasciitilde}]2\% to 8\%, much higher than the prevalence rate in the general population but much lower than in single-gene diseases. Twin studies reported 60\% concordance for classic autism in monozygotic ({MZ}) twins versus 0 in dizygotic ({DZ}) twins, the higher {MZ} concordance attesting to genetic inheritance as the predominant causative agent. Reevaluation for a broader autistic phenotype that included communication and social disorders increased concordance remarkably from 60\% to 92\% in {MZ} twins and from 0\% to 10\% in {DZ} pairs. This suggests that interactions between multiple genes cause "idiopathic" autism but that epigenetic factors and exposure to environmental modifiers may contribute to variable expression of autism-related traits. The identity and number of genes involved remain unknown. The wide phenotypic variability of the {ASDs} likely reflects the interaction of multiple genes within an individual's genome and the existence of distinct genes and gene combinations among those affected. There are 3 main approaches to identifying genetic loci, chromosomal regions likely to contain relevant genes: 1) whole genome screens, searching for linkage of autism to shared genetic markers in populations of multiplex families (families with {\textgreater}1 affected family member); 2) cytogenetic studies that may guide molecular studies by pointing to relevant inherited or de novo chromosomal abnormalities in affected individuals and their families; and 3) evaluation of candidate genes known to affect brain development in these significantly linked regions or, alternatively, linkage of candidate genes selected a priori because of their presumptive contribution to the pathogenesis of autism. Data from whole-genome screens in multiplex families suggest interactions of at least 10 genes in the causation of autism. Thus far, a putative speech and language region at 7q31-q33 seems most strongly linked to autism, with linkages to multiple other loci under investigation. Cytogenetic abnormalities at the 15q11-q13 locus are fairly frequent in people with autism, and a "chromosome 15 phenotype" was described in individuals with chromosome 15 duplications. Among other candidate genes are the {FOXP}2, {RAY}1/{ST}7, {IMMP}2L, and {RELN} genes at 7q22-q33 and the {GABAA} receptor subunit and {UBE}3A genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Variant alleles of the serotonin transporter gene (5-{HTT}) on 17q11-q12 are more frequent in individuals with autism than in nonautistic populations. In addition, animal models and linkage data from genome screens implicate the oxytocin receptor at 3p25-p26. Most pediatricians will have 1 or more children with this disorder in their practices. They must diagnose {ASD} expeditiously because early intervention increases its effectiveness. Children with dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies, mental retardation, or family members with developmental disorders are those most likely to benefit from extensive medical testing and genetic consultation. The yield of testing is much less in high-functioning children with a normal appearance and {IQ} and moderate social and language impairments. Genetic counseling justifies testing, but until autism genes are identified and their functions are understood, prenatal diagnosis will exist only for the rare cases ascribable to single-gene defects or overt chromosomal abnormalities. Parents who wish to have more children must be told of their increased statistical risk. It is crucial for pediatricians to try to involve families with multiple affected members in formal research projects, as family studies are key to unraveling the causes and pathogenesis of autism. Parents need to understand that they and their affected children are the only available sources for identifying and studying the elusive genes responsible for autism. Future clinically useful insights and potential medications depend on identifying these genes and elucidating the influences of their products on brain development and physiology.},

In the second model, early symptom improvement represents the principal guide in tailoring treatment, followed by baseline anxiety level, baseline sleep disturbance, and--for a minority of patients--the adequacy of previous antidepressant treatment. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our two models, developed to help clinicians in different clinical circumstances, illustrate the possibility of tailoring the treatment of late-life depression based on clinical characteristics and confirm the importance of early observed changes in clinical status.},

The aim of this study was to investigate melatonin-related findings in autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}), including autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorders, not otherwise specified.


{METHOD}

Comprehensive searches were conducted in the {PubMed}, Google Scholar, {CINAHL}, {EMBASE}, Scopus, and {ERIC} databases from their inception to October 2010. Two reviewers independently assessed 35 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, meta-analysis was performed on five randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, and the quality of these trials was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist.

Nine studies measured melatonin or melatonin metabolites in {ASD} and all reported at least one abnormality, including an abnormal melatonin circadian rhythm in four studies, below average physiological levels of melatonin and/or melatonin derivates in seven studies, and a positive correlation between these levels and autistic behaviors in four studies. Five studies reported gene abnormalities that could contribute to decreased melatonin production or adversely affect melatonin receptor function in a small percentage of children with {ASD}. Six studies reported improved daytime behavior with melatonin use. Eighteen studies on melatonin treatment in {ASD} were identified; these studies reported improvements in sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and night-time awakenings. Five of these studies were randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies; two of the studies contained blended samples of children with {ASD} and other developmental disorders, but only data for children with {ASD} were used in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found significant improvements with large effect sizes in sleep duration (73 min compared with baseline, Hedge's g 1.97 [95\% confidence interval \{{CI}\} {CI} 1.10-2.84], Glass's Δ 1.54 [95\% {CI} 0.64-2.44]; 44 min compared with placebo, Hedge's g 1.07 [95\% {CI} 0.49-1.65], Glass's Δ 0.93 [95\% {CI} 0.33-1.53]) and sleep onset latency (66 min compared with baseline, Hedge's g-2.42 [95\% {CI} -1.67 to -3.17], Glass's Δ-2.18 [95\% {CI} -1.58 to -2.76]; 39 min compared with placebo, Hedge's g-2.46 [95\% {CI} -1.96 to -2.98], Glass's Δ-1.28 [95\% {CI} -0.67 to -1.89]) but not in night-time awakenings. The effect size varied significantly across studies but funnel plots did not indicate publication bias. The reported side effects of melatonin were minimal to none. Some studies were affected by limitations, including small sample sizes and variability in the protocols that measured changes in sleep parameters.


{INTERPRETATION}

Melatonin administration in {ASD} is associated with improved sleep parameters, better daytime behavior, and minimal side effects. Additional studies of melatonin would be helpful to confirm and expand on these findings.},

Here, we investigate social learning in the context of the uniquely human capacity for reflective, analytical reasoning. A hallmark of the human mind is its ability to engage analytical reasoning, and suppress false associative intuitions. Through a set of laboratory-based network experiments, we find that social learning fails to propagate this cognitive strategy. When people make false intuitive conclusions and are exposed to the analytic output of their peers, they recognize and adopt this correct output. But they fail to engage analytical reasoning in similar subsequent tasks. Thus, humans exhibit an ‘unreflective copying bias’, which limits their social learning to the output, rather than the process, of their peers’ reasoning—even when doing so requires minimal effort and no technical skill. In contrast to much recent work on observation-based social learning, which emphasizes the propagation of successful behaviour through copying, our findings identify a limit on the power of social networks in situations that require analytical reasoning.},

First, I argue that the appeal to developmental neurobiology is often misplaced, as it focuses on neurodevelopmental processes that are mostly completed by the age at which neuroimaging studies can be performed. Second, I argue that the concept of “normative” development needs to be reexamined, as it reflects fundamental value judgments about brain development that seem inappropriate for scientific investigation. Third, I examine the ways in which developmental changes are often interpreted, arguing that common interpretations, including the concepts of “efficiency” and “focalization” may be less useful than commonly supposed. To put developmental neuroimaging on stronger footing, we need to develop stronger connections between computational and neurobiological accounts of developmental changes.

A common 44-base pair deletion (s allele) polymorphism in the 5-{HTTLPR} is associated with reduced 5HTT transcription efficiency and 5HT uptake in vitro. Methods: Subjects were 142 adult primary caregivers for a spouse or parent with dementia and 146 noncaregiver controls. Subjects underwent genotyping and completed the {PSQI}. Results: Variation in 5-{HTTLPR} genotype was not related to sleep quality as a main effect (p {\textgreater} .36).

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how the brain forms perceptual decisions about complex visual forms in a challenging task, requiring the discrimination of ambiguous 2-tone Mooney faces and visually similar nonface images. Face-selective areas in the ventral visual cortex showed greater activity when subjects reported perceiving a face as compared with a nonface, even on error trials. More important, activity was closely related to the time of the subject's decision for face judgments, even on individual trials, and resembled the time course of activity in motor cortex corresponding to the subject's behavioral report. These results indicate that perceptual decisions about ambiguous face-like stimuli are reflected early in the sensorimotor pathway, in face-selective regions of the ventral visual cortex. Activity in these areas may represent a potential rate-limiting step in the pathway from sensation to action when subjects must reach a decision about ambiguous face-like stimuli.},

	abstract = {{STUDY} {OBJECTIVES}

This study investigated the relationship between sleep loss and emotional reactivity in medical residents. We hypothesized that this relationship is shaped by the effect of sleep loss on cog-nitive-energy resources required for coping with goal-disruptive events or for capitalizing on new opportunities offered by goal-enhancing events.


{SETTINGS}

15 medical wards in 4 large hospitals in Israel.


{PARTICIPANTS}

78 medical residents, 67\% men, aged 26 to 39 years.


{DESIGN}

Actigraphic sleep-wake cycles were measured for 5- to 7-day periods, surrounding nightshifts, every 6 months, covering the first 2 years of residency. During each study period, emotional reactivity was investigated using the experience-sampling methodology by which residents received 3 phone calls at random times during their working day for 3 consecutive days. These calls reminded them to fill out brief questionnaires concerning change of circumstances over the previous 15 minutes and to rate their emotional response to these circumstances using the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scales. Fatigue at those times was measured by a subscale of the Profile of Mood States.


{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {RESULTS}

Multilevel regression analysis was used to determine the influence of sleep duration and sleep fragmentation on the emotional reactions to goal-disruptive and goal-enhancing daytime events. We found that sleep loss intensified negative emotions and fatigue following daytime disruptive events, while positive emotion was mitigated following goal-enhancing events. Sleep loss also resulted in an overall elevated baseline for positive emotion.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Sleep loss amplifies the negative emotive effects of disruptive events while reducing the positive effect of goal-enhancing events. Methodologically, the study highlights the utility and advantages of event-level analysis as opposed to the current practice of random sampling of emotion states during waking hours, disregarding contextual factors associated with purposeful, goal-oriented behavior episodes.},

The effect was mediated by feelings of empathy for another person but was not mediated by mood, state self-esteem, belongingness, trust, control, or self-awareness.

Analyses were based on 6 assessments across a 29-year period of a sample of 3,180 individuals aged 14 to 102 years. The results indicated that, as test–retest intervals increased, stability exponentially decayed and asymptotically approached a nonzero value (estimated as .43). The exponential decay function explained a large proportion of variance in observed stability coefficients, provided a better fit than alternative functions, and held across gender and for all age groups from adolescence to old age. Moreover, structural equation modeling of the individual-level data suggested that a perfectly stable trait component underlies stability of self-esteem. The findings suggest that the stability of self-esteem is relatively large, even across very long periods, and that self-esteem is a trait-like characteristic.},

	abstract = {Behavioural profiles can be shaped by genotype and environmental factors during early phases of life. The aim of this study was to investigate whether anxiety-like behaviour, exploration and adrenocortical stress responses can be modulated by genotype and social experiences in adulthood. Male mice lacking the serotonin transporter gene which is under scrutiny for anxiety disorders were compared with heterozygous and wildtype controls. Concerning social experiences, the males of all three genotypes were provided with a winner or a loser experience in a resident-intruder paradigm on three consecutive days. Anxiety-like behaviour and exploration were recorded in the dark-light, elevated plus-maze and open-field test. To non-invasively assess adrenocortical activity, corticosterone metabolites were determined from feces. The main findings were: Repeated social experience, irrespective of winning or losing, elevated levels of anxiety-like behaviour and decreased exploration. In losers a distinct effect of genotype occurred, with homozygous knockout males showing more anxiety-like behaviour and less exploration than the other genotypes. In winners no genotype-dependent variation was found. Genotypes did not differ in basal stress hormone secretion. There was, however, a main effect of social experience with higher activation of the stress hormone system in losers than in winners. This effect was strongest in the heterozygous genotype. In conclusion, our data show that anxiety circuits retain their plasticity throughout adulthood and can be shaped by genotype and social experiences during this phase of life. Moreover, responsiveness towards negative life experiences is influenced significantly by the 5-{HTT} genotype.},

The ability to accurately predict the thoughts and actions of others is essential for successful social interactions, with far-reaching consequences. Despite its importance, little is known about how the brain represents people in order to predict behavior. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants learned the unique personality of 4 protagonists and imagined how each would behave in different scenarios. The protagonists' personalities were composed of 2 traits: Agreeableness and Extraversion. Which protagonist was being imagined was accurately inferred based solely on activity patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex using multivariate pattern classification, providing novel evidence that brain activity can reveal whom someone is thinking about. Lateral temporal and posterior cingulate cortex discriminated between different degrees of agreeableness and extraversion, respectively. Functional connectivity analysis confirmed that regions associated with trait-processing and individual identities were functionally coupled. Activity during the imagination task, and revealed by functional connectivity, was consistent with the default network. Our results suggest that distinct regions code for personality traits, and that the brain combines these traits to represent individuals. The brain then uses this “personality model” to predict the behavior of others in novel situations.},

However, the computational processes used to make choices in more complicated situations involving three or more options are unknown. We propose a model of trinary value-based choice that generalizes what is known about binary choice, and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. We find that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of the relationship between choice, reaction time, and visual fixation data using the same parameters that were estimated in previous work on binary choice. Our findings suggest that the brain uses similar computational processes to make binary and trinary choices.},

Participants who had been mimicked were more helpful and generous toward other people than were non-mimicked participants. These beneficial consequences of mimicry were not restricted to behavior directed toward the mimicker, but included behavior directed toward people not directly involved in the mimicry situation. These results suggest that the effects of mimicry are not simply due to increased liking for the mimicker, but are due to increased prosocial orientation in general.},

	abstract = {Common theories of emotion emphasize valence and arousal dimensions or alternatively, specific emotions, and the search for the underlying neurocircuitry is underway. However, it is likely that other important dimensions for emotional neurocircuitry exist, and one of them is sociality. A social dimension may code whether emotions are addressing an individual's biological/visceral need versus more remote social goals involving semantic meaning or intentionality. Thus, for practical purposes, social emotions may be distinguished from nonsocial emotions based in part on the presence of human forms. In the current {fMRI} study, we aimed to compare regional coding of the sociality dimension of emotion (nonsocial versus social) versus the valence dimension of emotion (positive versus negative). Using a novel {fMRI} paradigm, film and picture stimuli were combined to induce and maintain four emotions varying along social and valence dimensions. Nonsocial emotions of positively valenced appetite and negatively valenced disgust and social emotions of positively valenced joy/amusement and negatively valenced sadness were studied. All conditions activated the thalamus. Appetite and disgust activated posterior insula and visual cortex, whereas joy/amusement and sadness activated extended amygdala, superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate. Activations within the anterior cingulate, nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala were modulated by both social and valence dimensions. Overall, these findings highlight that sociality has a key role in processing emotional valence, which may have implications for patient populations with social and emotional deficits.},

	abstract = {Multivariate machine learning methods are increasingly used to analyze neuroimaging data, often replacing more traditional “mass univariate” techniques that fit data one voxel at a time. In the functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) literature, this has led to broad application of “off-the-shelf” classification and regression methods. These generic approaches allow investigators to use ready-made algorithms to accurately decode perceptual, cognitive, or behavioral states from distributed patterns of neural activity. However, when applied to correlated whole-brain {fMRI} data these methods suffer from coefficient instability, are sensitive to outliers, and yield dense solutions that are hard to interpret without arbitrary thresholding. Here, we develop variants of the Graph-constrained Elastic-Net ({GraphNet}), a fast, whole-brain regression and classification method developed for spatially and temporally correlated data that automatically yields interpretable coefficient maps (Grosenick et al., 2009b). {GraphNet} methods yield sparse but structured solutions by combining structured graph constraints (based on knowledge about coefficient smoothness or connectivity) with a global sparsity-inducing prior that automatically selects important variables. Because {GraphNet} methods can efficiently fit regression or classification models to whole-brain, multiple time-point data sets and enhance classification accuracy relative to volume-of-interest ({VOI}) approaches, they eliminate the need for inherently biased {VOI} analyses and allow whole-brain fitting without the multiple comparison problems that plague mass univariate and roaming {VOI} (“searchlight”) methods. As {fMRI} data are unlikely to be normally distributed, we (1) extend {GraphNet} to include robust loss functions that confer insensitivity to outliers, (2) equip them with “adaptive” penalties that asymptotically guarantee correct variable selection, and (3) develop a novel sparse structured Support Vector {GraphNet} classifier ({SVGN}). When applied to previously published data (Knutson et al., 2007), these efficient whole-brain methods significantly improved classification accuracy over previously reported {VOI}-based analyses on the same data (Grosenick et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2007) while discovering task-related regions not documented in the original {VOI} approach. Critically, {GraphNet} estimates fit to the Knutson et al. (2007) data generalize well to out-of-sample data collected more than three years later on the same task but with different subjects and stimuli (Karmarkar et al., submitted for publication). By enabling robust and efficient selection of important voxels from whole-brain data taken over multiple time points (\&gt; 100,000 “features”), these methods enable data-driven selection of brain areas that accurately predict single-trial behavior within and across individuals.},

These are global, affecting nearly every body function, and have been related to two key pathophysiological findings in sleep apnoea: repetitive falls in oxyhaemoglobin saturation during sleep, and recurrent arousals from sleep which terminate apnoea episodes. Sufferers of {OSA} may experience daytime sleepiness, which has been measured both subjectively using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, but also objectively, using Multiple Sleep Latency Testing, Maintenance of Wakefulness testing, and the Oxford Sleep Resistance test. In addition to the loss of alertness, sleep apnoea contributes to memory deficits, reduced vigilance, impaired executive function, increased risk for automobile and occupational accidents, and decreased quality of life.Importantly, afflicted individuals experience improvements in these outcomes with treatment. Taken together, this evidence forms a compelling basis to identify and treat latent cases of sleep apnoea. Not only do patients have the opportunity to achieve improvements in these outcomes and health-related quality of life, but the enormous economic burden that untreated apnoea imposes on the health care system may be eased.},

Furthermore, a 6-factor model has been proposed to extend and update the Big Five model, in part by adding a dimension of Honesty/Humility or Honesty/Propriety. In this study, 3 popular brief to medium-length Big Five measures ({NEO} Five Factor Inventory, Big Five Inventory [{BFI}], and International Personality Item Pool), and 3 six-factor measures ({HEXACO} Personality Inventory, Questionnaire Big Six Scales, and a 6-factor version of the {BFI}) were placed in competition to best predict important student life outcomes. The effect of test length was investigated by comparing brief versions of most measures (subsets of items) with original versions. Personality questionnaires were administered to undergraduate students (N = 227). Participants' college transcripts and student conduct records were obtained 6–9 months after data was collected. Six-factor inventories demonstrated better predictive ability for life outcomes than did some Big Five inventories. Additional behavioral observations made on participants, including their Facebook profiles and cell-phone text usage, were predicted similarly by Big Five and 6-factor measures. A brief version of the {BFI} performed surprisingly well; across inventory platforms, increasing test length had little effect on predictive validity. Comparative validity of the models and measures in terms of outcome prediction and parsimony is discussed.},

In both streams, areas at intermediate processing stages in extrastriate cortex (V4, V3A, {MT} and V7) showed object-selective but viewpoint- and size-specific responses. In contrast, higher-order areas in lateral occipital and posterior parietal cortex ({LOC}, {IPS}1 and {IPS}2) responded selectively to objects independent of image transformations. Contrary to the two-pathways hypothesis, our findings indicate that basic object information related to shape, size and viewpoint may be represented similarly in two parallel and hierarchically organized neural systems in the ventral and dorsal visual pathways.},

We show that the control of full-body locomotion and the building of a conscious experience of it are at least partially distinct brain processes. The comparable effects on agency using audio-motor and visuo-motor cues as found in the present and previous agency work may reflect common supramodal mechanisms in conscious action monitoring.

It may instead be an artefact of experimentation. Alternatively, evaluations of options depend on the composition of the choice set.

	abstract = {{AbstractEvidence} of marked variability in response among people exposed to the same environmental risk implies that individual differences in genetic susceptibility might be at work. The study of such Gene-by-Environment ({GxE}) interactions has gained momentum. In this article, the authors review research about one of the most extensive areas of inquiry: variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene ({SLC}6A4; also known as 5-{HTT}) and its contribution to stress sensitivity. Research in this area has both advanced basic science and generated broader lessons for studying complex diseases and traits. The authors evaluate four lines of evidence about the 5-{HTT} stress-sensitivity hypothesis: 1) observational studies about the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-{HTTLPR}), stress sensitivity, and depression in humans; 2) experimental neuroscience studies about the 5-{HTTLPR} and biological phenotypes relevant to the human stress response; 3) studies of 5-{HTT} variation and stress sensitivity in nonhuman primates; and 4) studies of stress sensitivity and genetically engineered 5-{HTT} mutations in rodents. The authors then dispel some misconceptions and offer recommendations for {GxE} research. The authors discuss how {GxE} interaction hypotheses can be tested with large and small samples, how {GxE} research can be carried out before as well as after replicated gene discovery, the uses of {GxE} research as a tool for gene discovery, the importance of construct validation in evaluating {GxE} research, and the contribution of {GxE} research to the public understanding of genetic science.},

Here, we explored whether observing actions with different moral connotations modulates {MR} and whether any modulation depends on the onlookers’ personality. To this aim, we recorded motor potentials evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation from hand muscles of participants who were watching images of a model performing hand actions with the same postures and low-level goals (i.e. grasping an object) but with different moral connotations (‘stealing a wallet’ vs ‘picking up a notepaper’). Participants’ personality traits were measured using the temperament and character inventory. Results show a selective suppression of corticospinal excitability during observation of immoral actions in individuals with high scores in harm avoidance, a personality trait characterized by excessive worrying and fearfulness. Thus, a combination of dispositional (personality traits) and situational (morality of an action) variables appears to influence {MR} with the observed actions.},

We performed this study to test the accuracy of {EEG} mapping by examining the association between electrical activity and the perfusion under each electrode as another measure of local cerebral function.
Methods: {EEG} mapping was performed simultaneously with H215O positron emission tomography ({PET}) scanning in 6 normal adult subjects, both at rest and during a simple motor task. {EEG} data were processed using 3 different montages; two {EEG} power measures (absolute and relative power) were examined.
Results: Relative power had much stronger associations with perfusion than did absolute power. In addition, calculating power for bipolar electrode pairs and averaging power over electrode pairs sharing a common electrode yielded stronger associations with perfusion than data from referential or single source montages.
Conclusions: These findings indicate (1) that topographic {EEG} mapping can accurately reflect local brain function in a way that is comparable to other methods, and (2) that the choice of {EEG} measure and montage have a significant influence on the degree with which maps reflect this local activity and function.},

These differences emerged over the first week of life, were reversed with cross-fostering, persisted into adulthood and were associated with altered histone acetylation and transcription factor ({NGFI}-A) binding to the {GR} promoter. Central infusion of a histone deacetylase inhibitor removed the group differences in histone acetylation, {DNA} methylation, {NGFI}-A binding, {GR} expression and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) responses to stress, suggesting a causal relation among epigenomic state, {GR} expression and the maternal effect on stress responses in the offspring.

They were. Our second experiment using the same movies, tested whether both groups would spontaneously adopt the visuo-spatial perspective of a triangle protagonist. They did. At the same time autistic participants differed in their verbal accounts of the story line underlying the movies, confirming their specific difficulties in on-line mentalizing.

	abstract = {For many years, statistics textbooks have followed this ‘canonical’ procedure: (1) the reader is warned not to use the discredited methods of Bayes and Laplace, (2) an orthodox method is extolled as superior and applied to a few simple problems, (3) the corresponding Bayesian solutions are not worked out or described in any way. The net result is that no evidence whatsoever is offered to substantiate the claim of superiority of the orthodox method. To correct this situation we exhibit the Bayesian and orthodox solutions to six common statistical problems involving confidence intervals (including significance tests based on the same reasoning). In every case, we find that the situation is exactly the opposite; i.e., the Bayesian method is easier to apply and yields the same or better results. Indeed, the orthodox results are satisfactory only when they agree closely (or exactly) with the Bayesian results. No contrary example has yet been produced. By a refinement of the orthodox statistician’s own criterion of performance, the best confidence interval for any location or scale parameter is proved to be the Bayesian posterior probability interval. In the cases of point estimation and hypothesis testing, similar proofs have long been known. We conclude that orthodox claims of superiority are totally unjustified; today, the original statistical methods of Bayes and Laplace stand in a position of proven superiority in actual performance, that places them beyond the reach of mere ideological or philosophical attacks. It is the continued teaching and use of orthodox methods that is in need of justification and defense.},

Although youth reported exposure to independent living training while in care, few reported concrete assistance. Multiple placements while in care and less education correlated with more difficult postdischarge functioning. Training, services, positive supportive networks, and job experience in care are associated with more positive adjustments. The article advances implications for program and policy interventions.},

This hypothesis was tested with multi-method, longitudinal data obtained on a diverse community sample of 185 adolescents. Sociometric popularity data were examined in relation to data from interview-based assessments of attachment security and ego development, observations of mother-adolescent interactions, and repeated self- and peer-report assessments of delinquency and alcohol use. Results indicated that popular adolescents displayed higher concurrent levels of ego development, secure attachment and more adaptive interactions with mothers and best friends. Longitudinal analyses supported a “popularity-socialization” hypothesis, however, in which popular adolescents were more likely to increase in behaviors that receive approval in the peer group (e.g., minor levels of drug use and delinquency) and decrease in behaviors unlikely to be well-received by peers (e.g., hostile behavior with peers).},

We measured regional brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) during an interoceptive task wherein subjects judged the timing of their own heartbeats. We observed enhanced activity in insula, somatomotor and cingulate cortices. In right anterior insular/opercular cortex, neural activity predicted subjects' accuracy in the heartbeat detection task. Furthermore, local gray matter volume in the same region correlated with both interoceptive accuracy and subjective ratings of visceral awareness. Indices of negative emotional experience correlated with interoceptive accuracy across subjects. These findings indicate that right anterior insula supports a representation of visceral responses accessible to awareness, providing a substrate for subjective feeling states.},

	abstract = {Mirror neurons in macaque area F5 fire when an animal performs an action, such as a mouth or limb movement, and also when the animal passively observes an identical or similar action performed by another individual. Brain-imaging studies in humans conducted over the last 20 years have repeatedly attempted to reveal analogous brain regions with mirror properties in humans, with broad and often speculative claims about their functional significance across a range of cognitive domains, from language to social cognition. Despite such concerted efforts, the likely neural substrates of these mirror regions have remained controversial, and indeed the very existence of a distinct subcategory of human neurons with mirroring properties has been questioned. Here we used activation likelihood estimation ({ALE}), to provide a quantitative index of the consistency of patterns of {fMRI} activity measured in human studies of action observation and action execution. From an initial sample of more than 300 published works, data from 125 papers met our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analysis revealed 14 separate clusters in which activation has been consistently attributed to brain regions with mirror properties, encompassing 9 different Brodmann areas. These clusters were located in areas purported to show mirroring properties in the macaque, such as the inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus and the adjacent ventral premotor cortex, but surprisingly also in regions such as the primary visual cortex, cerebellum and parts of the limbic system. Our findings suggest a core network of human brain regions that possess mirror properties associated with action observation and execution, with additional areas recruited during tasks that engage non-motor functions, such as auditory, somatosensory and affective components.},

	abstract = {The emergence of cognitive deficits in a subgroup of aged rats is associated with increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, decreased hippocampal mineralocorticoid and/or glucocorticoid receptor gene expression and neuronal loss. Short-term treatment with antidepressant drugs in young rats increases hippocampal corticosteroid receptor gene expression. In this study, the effects of chronic antidepressant administration on hippocampal mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor gene expression and spatial memory in young and aged rats were investigated. Young (eight months) and old (22 Â± 1 months) Lister-hooded rats were ranked according to watermaze performance. Matched pairs of rats were treated with amitriptyline (10 mg/kg) or saline daily for nine weeks, then reassessed in the watermaze. Amitriptyline significantly improved spatial memory in the young rats (33\% increase in transfer test time) and increased hippocampal mineralocorticoid, but not glucocorticoid receptor messenger {RNA} expression. By contrast, in aged rats, amitriptyline had no effect on spatial memory or hippocampal corticosteroid receptor gene expression, either in cognitively unimpaired or cognitively-impaired animals. In aged rats, basal plasma corticosterone levels, which were significantly higher than in young animals, correlated negatively with spatial memory, while hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor {mRNA} expression correlated negatively with plasma corticosterone levels and positively with spatial memory. Amitriptyline had no significant effect on basal morning plasma corticosterone levels in either young or aged rats, but significantly decreased evening corticosterone levels in aged rats.

Our data support the notion that corticosterone exerts a concentration-dependent biphasic influence, via selective activation of hippocampal mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor, on spatial memory. Amitriptyline improves spatial memory in young rats and increases hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor gene expression. The lack of amitriptyline effect on spatial memory in aged rats may reflect decreased plasticity of both the synaptic processes underlying spatial memory and the regulation of hippocampal mineralocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor expression, with mineralocorticoid receptors fully occupied due to elevated basal plasma corticosterone levels (in part a consequence of inadequate glucocorticoid receptor function).},

	abstract = {The distinction between processes used to perceive and understand the self and others has received considerable attention in psychology and neuroscience. Brain findings highlight a role for various regions, in particular the medial {PFC} ({mPFC}), in supporting judgments about both the self and others. We performed a meta-analysis of 107 neuroimaging studies of self- and other-related judgments using multilevel kernel density analysis [Kober, H., \& Wager, T. D. Meta-analyses of neuroimaging data. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews, 1, 293–300, 2010]. We sought to determine what brain regions are reliably involved in each judgment type and, in particular, what the spatial and functional organization of {mPFC} is with respect to them. Relative to nonmentalizing judgments, both self- and other judgments were associated with activity in {mPFC}, ranging from ventral to dorsal extents, as well as common activation of the left {TPJ} and posterior cingulate. A direct comparison between self- and other judgments revealed that ventral {mPFC} as well as left ventrolateral {PFC} and left insula were more frequently activated by self-related judgments, whereas dorsal {mPFC}, in addition to bilateral {TPJ} and cuneus, was more frequently activated by other-related judgments. Logistic regression analyses revealed that ventral and dorsal {mPFC} lay at opposite ends of a functional gradient: The z coordinates reported in individual studies predicted whether the study involved self- or other-related judgments, which were associated with increasingly ventral or dorsal portions of {mPFC}, respectively. These results argue for a distributed rather than localizationist account of {mPFC} organization and support an emerging view on the functional heterogeneity of {mPFC}.},

	abstract = {The human serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) gene is one of the most extensively studied in psychiatry. A functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the 5-{HTT} gene (5-{HTTLPR}) has been associated with several psychiatric disorders as well as anxiety-related personality traits. In search of a mechanistic understanding of the functional implications of 5-{HTTLPR}, the influence of this polymorphism on regional 5-{HT}1A receptor density has previously been examined in two positron emission tomography ({PET}) studies in humans, yielding, however, contradictory results. In the present study, 54 control subjects were examined with [11C]{WAY} 100635 {PET} and a battery of cognitive tests. Regional binding potential ({BP}) of [11C]{WAY} 100635 to 5-{HT}1A receptor was calculated for the dorsal raphe nuclei, the hippocampus, the anterior cingulate, the insula, the temporal cortex and the frontal cortex. The influence of 5-{HTTLPR} genotype on regional 5-{HT}1A {BP} and cognitive performance was investigated. No differences in 5-{HT}1A receptor density between carriers and non-carriers of the S allele were found. Thus, we could not replicate any of the previously reported associations between 5-{HTTLPR} and 5-{HT}1A density. There was, however, a highly significant association between 5-{HTTLPR} genotype and performance in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; carriers of the S allele had a superior performance compared to the {LL} carriers. These observations suggest that functional implications of the 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphism are not likely to be mediated by differences in 5-{HT}1A expression levels and that other biomarkers must be considered for future investigations at phenotype level.},

Linkage analysis in our dataset of 57 New England and 80 {AGRE} multiplex autism families reveals a multipoint heterogeneity {LOD} ({HLOD}) score of 2.74 at D17S1871 in 17q11.2. Analysis of phenotypic subsets shows an increased {HLOD} of 3.62 in families with compulsive behaviors and rigidity. The serotonin transporter locus ({SLC}6A4) maps nearby and is considered a functional candidate gene in autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We genotyped an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter (5-{HTTLPR}), and seven single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) across the 38-kb transcriptional unit. Transmission disequilibrium ({TD}) analysis reveals nominal association at a {SNP} in intron 5 (P = 0.02) as well as 5-{HTTLPR} (P = 0.01), corresponding to over-transmission of the short allele. {TD} analysis in the rigid-compulsive subset shows no evidence for association. Intermarker linkage disequilibrium was determined. All {SNPs} define a single haplotype block, while 5-{HTTLPR} lies 5prime to this block. Three {SNPs} are sufficient to detect all common alleles (ge5\%) in this \&gt; 26-kb block. Analysis of haplotypes for these markers demonstrates no evidence for association to autism. These data indicate that a common allele within the coding region of {SLC}6A4 is not responsible for the observed linkage. However, the presence of heterogeneous disease variants within the block or the existence of a common disease-associated allele either upstream or downstream of this block is possible. In fact, such variants may well account for linkage to 17q11.2 in our families. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The serotonin transporter gene ({SLC}6A4) is a strong autism candidate gene because of its association with anxiety, aggression and attention, and the effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}) in treating certain behavioral symptoms. In families with individuals with autism, several reports of biased transmission of both alleles (short, long) at the serotonin transporter gene promotor polymorphism (5-{HTTLPR}) locus of {SLC}6A4 now exist. The heterogeneity in these reports may be due to clinical heterogeneity. The authors hypothesized that 5-{HTTLPR} genotypes would be related to variation in specific symptoms in children with autism. {METHOD}: The authors explored whether variants of two functional polymorphisms of {SLC}6A4 (5-{HTTLPR}, intron 2 variable number tandem repeat [2 {VNTR}]) were related to behavioral characteristics measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Subjects (N=73, age 3-19 years old) met diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder based on both measures. {RESULTS}: Evidence of genotype-phenotype interactions on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised was found with the 5-{HTTLPR} short group of {HTTLPR} (S/L or S/S genotypes) being rated as more severe on the subdomain "failure to use nonverbal communication to regulate social interaction," and the long group (L/L genotype) being more severe on the subdomain "stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms" and on an aggression measure. In contrast, on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, the long group was associated with greater severity on directed facial expressions and unusual sensory interests. There were no significant relationships between the intron 2 {VNTR} genotypes and subdomains or domains of symptoms on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings provide initial support for genotype-specific phenotypes for 5-{HTTLPR} in autism based on ratings from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.},

	abstract = {Context Autism is considered the most heritable of neurodevelopmental disorders, mainly because of the large difference in concordance rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Objective To provide rigorous quantitative estimates of genetic heritability of autism and the effects of shared environment. Design, Setting, and Participants Twin pairs with at least 1 twin with an autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) born between 1987 and 2004 were identified through the California Department of Developmental Services. Main Outcome Measures Structured diagnostic assessments (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) were completed on 192 twin pairs. Concordance rates were calculated and parametric models were fitted for 2 definitions, 1 narrow (strict autism) and 1 broad ({ASD}). Results For strict autism, probandwise concordance for male twins was 0.58 for 40 monozygotic pairs (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 0.42-0.74) and 0.21 for 31 dizygotic pairs (95\% {CI}, 0.09-0.43); for female twins, the concordance was 0.60 for 7 monozygotic pairs (95\% {CI}, 0.28-0.90) and 0.27 for 10 dizygotic pairs (95\% {CI}, 0.09-0.69). For {ASD}, the probandwise concordance for male twins was 0.77 for 45 monozygotic pairs (95\% {CI}, 0.65-0.86) and 0.31 for 45 dizygotic pairs (95\% {CI}, 0.16-0.46); for female twins, the concordance was 0.50 for 9 monozygotic pairs (95\% {CI}, 0.16-0.84) and 0.36 for 13 dizygotic pairs (95\% {CI}, 0.11-0.60). A large proportion of the variance in liability can be explained by shared environmental factors (55\%; 95\% {CI}, 9\%-81\% for autism and 58\%; 95\% {CI}, 30\%-80\% for {ASD}) in addition to moderate genetic heritability (37\%; 95\% {CI}, 8\%-84\% for autism and 38\%; 95\% {CI}, 14\%-67\% for {ASD}). Conclusion Susceptibility to {ASD} has moderate genetic heritability and a substantial shared twin environmental component.},

	abstract = {Large, population-based samples and large-scale genotyping are being used to evaluate disease/gene associations. A substantial drawback to such samples is the fact that population substructure can induce spurious associations between genes and disease. We review two methods, called genomic control ({GC}) and structured association ({SA}), that obviate many of the concerns about population substructure by using the features of the genomes present in the sample to correct for stratification. The {GC} approach exploits the fact that population substructure generates ldquoover dispersionrdquo of statistics used to assess association. By testing multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, only some of which are pertinent to the disease of interest, the degree of overdispersion generated by population substructure can be estimated and taken into account. The {SA} approach assumes that the sampled population, although heterogeneous, is composed of subpopulations that are themselves homogeneous. By using multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, this ldquolatent class methodrdquo estimates the probability sampled individuals derive from each of these latent subpopulations. {GC} has the advantage of robustness, simplicity, and wide applicability, even to experimental designs such as {DNA} pooling. {SA} is a bit more complicated but has the advantage of greater power in some realistic settings, such as admixed populations or when association varies widely across subpopulations. It, too, is widely applicable. Both also have weaknesses, as elaborated in our review. Genet. Epidemiol. 21:273-284, 2001. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This study aimed to define a single genotype effect of three polymorphic markers in the 5-{HTT} gene (5-{HTTLPR}, A/G {SNP} in 5-{HTTLPR} and {STin}2 {VNTR}) and to check possible association of the 5-{HTT} haplotypes and personality traits [assessed with Eysenck Personality Inventory ({EPI}) and Temperament and Character Inventory ({TCI}) questionnaires] in 301 healthy young individuals. {METHODS}: To investigate single genotype and haplotype effects of all polymorphic markers, multivariate analysis of variance and haplotype trend regression analyses were conducted correspondingly. {RESULTS}: Individuals with {STin}2.10 allele scored significantly lower on Neuroticism ({EPI}) (P=0.007) and Harm Avoidance (P=0.005) in the overall sample. The same pattern of association was reported in women: carriers of {STin}2.10 allele scored lower on Harm Avoidance ({TCI}) (P=0.008). Haplotype trend regression analyses revealed that carriers of S12 haplotype had lower sociability-related traits such as Extraversion ({EPI}) and Novelty Seeking ({TCI}), whereas Harm Avoidance ({TCI}) (anxiety-related trait) was higher. Opposite association was observed for S10 haplotype: Extraversion ({EPI}) score was higher, whereas Harm Avoidance ({TCI}) score was lower in carriers of this haplotype. {CONCLUSION}: As single polymorphism effect of {STin}2 was observed in relation to anxiety-related traits, opposite S10 and S12 haplotype effects on Neuroticism and Harm Avoidance could be explained by the larger impact of {STin}2 polymorphism. Controversially, we consider that the variance in sociability-related traits is related to specific haplotypes of 5-{HTT} gene.},

An insertion/deletion polymorphism (5-{HTTLPR}) in the promoter region and a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism ({VNTR}) in the second intron, were previously identified and suggested to modulate transcription. Six previous family-based association studies of {SLC}6A4 in autistic disorder have been conducted, with four studies showing nominally significant transmission disequilibrium and two studies with no evidence of nominally significant transmission disequilibrium. In the present study, {TDT} was conducted in 81 new trios. A previous finding of transmission disequilibrium between a haplotype consisting of the 5-{HTTLPR} and intron 2 {VNTR} was replicated in this study, but not preferential transmission of 5-{HTTLPR} as an independent marker. Because of inconsistent transmission of 5-{HTTLPR} across studies, {SLC}6A4 and its flanking regions were sequenced in 10 probands, followed by typing of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and seven simple sequence repeat ({SSR}) polymorphisms in 115 autism trios. When individual markers were analyzed by {TDT}, seven {SNP} markers and four {SSR} markers (six {SNPs}, 5-{HTTLPR} and the second intron {VNTR} from promoter 1A through intron 2 of {SLC}6A4, one {SSR} from intron 7 of {SLC}6A4, one {SNP} from the bleomycin hydrolase gene ({BLMH}, {MIM} 602403) and one {SSR} telomeric to {BLMH}) showed nominally significant evidence of transmission disequilibrium.

	abstract = {Background: Intact emotion processing is critical for normal emotional development. Recent advances in neuroimaging have facilitated the examination of brain development, and have allowed for the exploration of the relationships between the development of emotion processing abilities, and that of associated neural systems.Methods: A literature review was performed of published studies examining the development of emotion expression recognition in normal children and psychiatric populations, and of the development of neural systems important for emotion processing.Results: Few studies have explored the development of emotion expression recognition throughout childhood and adolescence. Behavioural studies suggest continued development throughout childhood and adolescence (reflected by accuracy scores and speed of processing), which varies according to the category of emotion displayed. Factors such as sex, socio-economic status, and verbal ability may also affect this development. Functional neuroimaging studies in adults highlight the role of the amygdala in emotion processing. Results of the few neuroimaging studies in children have focused on the role of the amygdala in the recognition of fearful expressions. Although results are inconsistent, they provide evidence throughout childhood and adolescence for the continued development of and sex differences in amygdalar function in response to fearful expressions. Studies exploring emotion expression recognition in psychiatric populations of children and adolescents suggest deficits that are specific to the type of disorder and to the emotion displayed.Conclusions: Results from behavioural and neuroimaging studies indicate continued development of emotion expression recognition and neural regions important for this process throughout childhood and adolescence. Methodological inconsistencies and disparate findings make any conclusion difficult, however. Further studies are required examining the relationship between the development of emotion expression recognition and that of underlying neural systems, in particular subcortical and prefrontal cortical structures. These will inform understanding of the neural bases of normal and abnormal emotional development, and aid the development of earlier interventions for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Data from a cross-sectional sample (N = 601 men and women) and a longitudinal sample (N = 125 women) were used to test hypotheses about the development of Big Five domains and facets from early adulthood through middle age. Analyses of mean-level age trends indicated that overall Agreeableness and Conscientiousness increased with age and that several facets showed distinctive trends that replicated across the samples. Cross-sectional analyses of trait intercorrelations and covariances indicated that interrelations between the Big Five domains, and between their more specific facets, were quite similar at older versus younger ages. Finally, longitudinal analyses of individual-level changes indicated that (a) different people's personalities changed in markedly different ways; (b) these changes were predominantly independent, rather than correlated, across Big Five domains; and (c) the pattern of change correlations between Big Five facets could be explained by the facets’ interrelations at the first assessment time. Taken together, these results suggest that a complete understanding of personality development requires consideration of facet-level traits and that adult personality development is predominantly influenced by narrowly acting mechanisms that each affect a single Big Five domain, or a small cluster of related facets, rather than by broadly acting mechanisms that simultaneously affect previously independent traits.},

Through use of data from a longitudinal sample of 5th and 6th graders who were participating in the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development ({PYD}), structural equation modeling procedure, reliability analyses, and assessments of convergent, divergent, and predictive validity suggested that a global, 9-item form of the {SOC} measure was a valid index of intentional self-regulation in early adolescence. Scores for this index of {SOC} were related to indicators of positive and negative development in predicted directions.

Machine learning algorithms were used to build a classifier to predict each personality trait from power spectra of the resting state {EEG} data. The results indicate that the five dimensions as well as their subordinate aspects could not be predicted from the resting state {EEG} data. Finally, to demonstrate that this result is not due to systematic algorithmic or implementation mistakes the same methods were used to successfully classify whether the subject had eyes open or eyes closed and whether the subject was male or female. These results indicate that the extraction of personality traits from the power spectra of resting state {EEG} is extremely noisy, if possible at all.},

	abstract = {Children from 10 sites in the United States were followed from birth to age 3 to determine how experiences in child care relate to cognitive and language development (Ns varied between 595 and 856, depending on the assessment). Multiple assessments of family and child care environments and of cognitive and language competence were collected. Analyses that adjusted for maternal vocabulary score, family income, child gender, observed quality of the home environment, and observed maternal cognitive stimulation indicated that the overall quality of child care, and language stimulation in particular, was consistently but modestly related to cognitive and language outcomes at ages 15, 24, and 36 months. The effect sizes for high (top quartile) versus low (bottom quartile) quality ranged from .18 to .48. After adjusting for child care quality, cumulative experience in center-based care was associated with better outcomes than was participation in other types of care. The amount of time children spent in care was not related to outcomes. Children in exclusive maternal care did not differ systematically from children in child care. Tests for lagged relations of earlier child care experiences to later performance (adjusting for current child care) showed that language stimulation predicted subsequent cognitive and language performance 9 to 12 months later. Although children in center care at age 3 performed better than children in other types of care, earlier experience in child care homes was associated with better performance at age 3 than was experience in other types of care. The relations of child care variables to outcomes did not vary consistently as a function of family income, quality of home environment, child gender, or ethnic group.},

	abstract = {A commonly occurring polymorphic variant of the human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-{HT}) transporter (5-{HTT}) gene that increases 5-{HTT} expression has been associated with reduced anxiety levels in human volunteer and patient populations. However, it is not known whether this linkage between genotype and anxiety relates to variation in 5-{HTT} expression and consequent changes in 5-{HT} transmission. Here we test this hypothesis by measuring the neurochemical and behavioral characteristics of a mouse genetically engineered to overexpress the 5-{HTT}. Transgenic mice overexpressing the human 5-{HTT} (h5-{HTT}) were produced from a 500 kb yeast artificial chromosome construct. These transgenic mice showed the presence of h5-{HTT} {mRNA} in the midbrain raphe nuclei, as well as a twofold to threefold increase in 5-{HTT} binding sites in the raphe nuclei and a range of forebrain regions. The transgenic mice had reduced regional brain whole-tissue levels of 5-{HT} and, in microdialysis experiments, decreased brain extracellular 5-{HT}, which reversed on administration of the 5-{HTT} inhibitor paroxetine. Compared with wild-type mice, the transgenic mice exhibited a low-anxiety phenotype in plus maze and hyponeophagia tests. Furthermore, in the plus maze test, the low-anxiety phenotype of the transgenic mice was reversed by acute administration of paroxetine, suggesting a direct link between the behavior, 5-{HTT} overexpression, and low extracellular 5-{HT}. In toto, these findings demonstrate that associations between increased 5-{HTT} expression and anxiety can be modeled in mice and may be specifically mediated by decreases in 5-{HT} transmission.},

	abstract = {To what extent do we share feelings with others? Neuroimaging investigations of the neural mechanisms involved in the perception of pain in others may cast light on one basic component of human empathy, the interpersonal sharing of affect. In this {fMRI} study, participants were shown a series of still photographs of hands and feet in situations that are likely to cause pain, and a matched set of control photographs without any painful events. They were asked to assess on-line the level of pain experienced by the person in the photographs. The results demonstrated that perceiving and assessing painful situations in others was associated with significant bilateral changes in activity in several regions notably, the anterior cingulate, the anterior insula, the cerebellum, and to a lesser extent the thalamus. These regions are known to play a significant role in pain processing. Finally, the activity in the anterior cingulate was strongly correlated with the participants' ratings of the others' pain, suggesting that the activity of this brain region is modulated according to subjects' reactivity to the pain of others. Our findings suggest that there is a partial cerebral commonality between perceiving pain in another individual and experiencing it oneself. This study adds to our understanding of the neurological mechanisms implicated in intersubjectivity and human empathy.},

We reasoned that prior null findings may be attributable to a failure to account for the fundamentally interpersonal nature of empathy, and tested the prediction that empathic accuracy may depend on both targets' tendency to express emotion and perceivers' tendency to empathically share that emotion. Using a continuous affect-rating paradigm, we found that perceivers' trait affective empathy was unrelated to empathic accuracy unless targets' trait expressivity was taken into account: Perceivers' trait affective empathy predicted accuracy only for expressive targets. These data suggest that perceivers' self-reported affective empathy can indeed predict their empathic accuracy, but only when targets' expressivity allows their thoughts and feelings to be read.},

Instead, theories of action selection during action execution indicate that a ventral pathway, linking middle temporal gyrus with the anterior inferior frontal gyrus, might encode these abstract features during action observation.

Ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}) has routinely been implicated in social cognitive tasks that rely on such absolute judgments about the self or others, but it is unclear whether activity in this region is modulated by personal relevance of social stimuli or self-similarity of judgment targets. Using {fMRI}, we demonstrate that these forces interact to determine {vmPFC} response during social comparisons, as well as neural activity in the bilateral anterior insulae. Comparisons between the self and similar others exhibit a unique response in this region when compared to other judgment contexts, suggesting that the special psychological status afforded to these social comparisons is indexed by activity in the {vmPFC} and insula.},

	abstract = {Emotion regulation plays a crucial role in adaptive functioning and mounting evidence suggests that some emotion regulation strategies are often more effective than others. However, little attention has been paid to the different ways emotions can be generated: from the ‘bottom-up’ (in response to inherently emotional perceptual properties of the stimulus) or ‘top-down’ (in response to cognitive evaluations). Based on a process priming principle, we hypothesized that mode of emotion generation would interact with subsequent emotion regulation. Specifically, we predicted that top-down emotions would be more successfully regulated by a top-down regulation strategy than bottom-up emotions. To test this hypothesis, we induced bottom-up and top-down emotions, and asked participants to decrease the negative impact of these emotions using cognitive reappraisal. We observed the predicted interaction between generation and regulation in two measures of emotional responding. As measured by self-reported affect, cognitive reappraisal was more successful on top-down generated emotions than bottom-up generated emotions. Neurally, reappraisal of bottom-up generated emotions resulted in a paradoxical increase of amygdala activity. This interaction between mode of emotion generation and subsequent regulation should be taken into account when comparing of the efficacy of different types of emotion regulation, as well as when reappraisal is used to treat different types of clinical disorders.},

Although the neural substrates supporting reflection upon one's own feelings have been investigated, no studies have directly examined attributions about the internal emotional states of others to determine whether common or distinct neural systems support these abilities. The present study sought to directly compare brain regions involved in judging one's own, as compared to another individual's, emotional state. Thirteen participants viewed mixed valence blocks of photos drawn from the International Affective Picture System while whole-brain {fMRI} data were collected. Preblock cues instructed participants to evaluate either their emotional response to each photo, the emotional state of the central figure in each photo, or (in a baseline condition) whether the photo was taken indoors or outdoors. Contrasts indicated (1) that both self and other judgments activated the medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}), the superior temporal gyrus, and the posterior cingulate/precuneus, (2) that self judgments selectively activated subregions of the {MPFC} and the left temporal cortex, whereas (3) other judgments selectively activated the left lateral prefrontal cortex (including Broca's area) and the medial occipital cortex. These results suggest (1) that self and other evaluation of emotion rely on a network of common mechanisms centered on the {MPFC}, which has been hypothesized to support mental state attributions in general, and (2) that medial and lateral {PFC} regions selectively recruited by self or other judgments may be involved in attention to, and elaboration of, internally as opposed to externally generated information.},

Latent Growth Modeling ({LGM}) was used to evaluate potential causal relationships between Tea Party identification and these factors. Across time points, racial prejudice was indirectly associated with movement identification through Whites’ assertions of national decline. Although initial levels of White identity did not predict change in Tea Party identification, initial levels of Tea Party identification predicted increases in White identity over the study period. Across the three assessments, support for the Tea Party fell among libertarians, but rose among social conservatives. Results are discussed in terms of legitimation theories of prejudice, the “racializing” power of political judgments, and the ideological dynamics of the Tea Party.},

	abstract = {Brothers has proposed that the amygdala is an important component of the neural network that underlies social cognition. And Bauman and Kemper observed signs of neuropathology in the amygdala of the post-mortem autistic brain. These findings, in addition to recent functional neuroimaging data, have led Baron-Cohen and colleagues to propose that dysfunction of the amygdala may be responsible, in part, for the impairment of social functioning that is a hallmark feature of autism. Recent data from studies in our laboratory on the effects of amygdala lesions in the macaque monkey are at variance with a fundamental role for the amygdala in social behaviour. If the amygdala is not essential for normal social behaviour, as seems to be the case in both non-human primates and selected patients with bilateral amygdala damage, then it is unlikely to be the substrate for the abnormal social behaviour of autism. However, damage to the amygdala does have an effect on a monkey's response to normally fear-inducing stimuli, such as snakes, and removes a natural reluctance to engage novel conspecifics in social interactions. These findings lead to the conclusion that an important role for the amygdala is in the detection of threats and mobilizing an appropriate behavioural response, part of which is fear. If the amygdala is pathological in subjects with autism, it may contribute to their abnormal fears and increased anxiety rather than their abnormal social behaviour.},

However, there is a paucity of tools for assessing emotion regulation during the middle childhood and adolescent years. This study reports on the psychometric evaluation of the 16-item self-report Emotion Regulation Index for Children and Adolescents ({ERICA}) involving a sample of 1,389 (768 girls, 621 boys) Australian children and adolescents aged 9 to 16 years. Convergent validity for the {ERICA} is reported with measures of self-conscious emotions (shame, guilt), empathy, childhood depressive symptomatology, and the perceived parenting dimensions of Care and Overprotection. Construct validity assessment using Principal Components Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis yielded three factors: (1) Emotional Control, (2) Emotional Self-Awareness, and (3) Situational Responsiveness. The {ERICA} was also found to have good internal consistency and to be relatively stable over a four week test-retest period and to be sensitive to age and sex differences. It is concluded that the {ERICA} is a psychometrically sound measure for the assessment of the identified key aspects of emotion regulation in children and adolescents.},

	abstract = {Facial expressions contain both motor and emotional components. The inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}) and posterior parietal cortex have been considered to compose a mirror neuron system ({MNS}) for the motor components of facial expressions, while the amygdala and insula may represent an “additional” {MNS} for emotional states. Together, these systems may contribute to our understanding of facial expressions. Here we further examine this possibility. In three separate event-related {fMRI} experiment, subjects had to (1) observe (2) discriminate and (3) imitate facial expressions. Stimuli were dynamic neutral, happy, fearful and disgusted facial expressions, and in Experiments 1 and 2, an additional pattern motion condition. Importantly, during each experiment, subjects were unaware of the nature of the next experiments. Results demonstrate that even passive viewing of facial expressions activates a wide network of brain regions that were also involved in the execution of similar expressions, including the {IFG}/insula and the posterior parietal cortex. Only a subset of these regions responded more during the observation of facial than pattern motion (bilateral ventral {IFG}, bilateral {STS}/{MTG}, bilateral amygdala, {SMA}). While the viewing of facial expressions recruited similar brain regions in all three experiments, adding an active task (discrimination, imitation) augmented the magnitude of these activations. Brain activations reflected differences in observed facial expressions, with emotional expressions activating relatively more the insula/frontal operculum, and neutral ones (blowing up the cheeks) the somatosensory cortices ({SII}). Using movies, fear activated the amygdala and disgust the insula, but other emotions activated these structures to a similar degree.},

To study the possible role of the amygdala in the recognition of happy and sad facial expressions in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years. 
Method 
Twelve healthy adolescents (6 females and 6 males) underwent noninvasive 3-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing pictures of happy, sad, and neutral facial expressions. 
Results 
Happy faces produced significant bilateral amygdalar activation when compared with neutral faces (p \&lt; .05, corrected). Sad faces relative to neutral did not produce significant amygdalar activation. 
Conclusions 
These results extend the role of the amygdala in adolescents to include the recognition of happy facial expressions. They demonstrate the feasibility of using happy facial expressions to noninvasively study amygdalar function in adolescents and establish a baseline against which the amygdalar response to emotional stimuli in several psychiatric conditions may be compared.},

	abstract = {The mothers of infant rats show individual differences in the frequency of licking/grooming and arched-back nursing ({LG}-{ABN}) of pups that contribute to the development of individual differences in behavioral responses to stress. As adults, the offspring of mothers that exhibited high levels of {LG}-{ABN} showed substantially reduced behavioral fearfulness in response to novelty compared with the offspring of low {LG}-{ABN} mothers. In addition, the adult offspring of the high {LG}-{ABN} mothers showed significantly (i) increased central benzodiazepine receptor density in the central, lateral, and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala as well as in the locus ceruleus, (ii) increased α2 adrenoreceptor density in the locus ceruleus, and (iii) decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone ({CRH}) receptor density in the locus ceruleus. The expression of fear and anxiety is regulated by a neural circuitry that includes the activation of ascending noradrenergic projections from the locus ceruleus to the forebrain structures. Considering the importance of the amygdala, notably the anxiogenic influence of {CRH} projections from the amygdala to the locus ceruleus, as well as the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines, for the expression of behavioral responses to stress, these findings suggest that maternal care during infancy serves to “program” behavioral responses to stress in the offspring by altering the development of the neural systems that mediate fearfulness.},

Extending previous research on this topic (see Craik et al., 1999), the present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate potential neural substrates of self-referential processing. Participants were imaged while making judgments about trait adjectives under three experimental conditions (self-relevance, other-relevance, or case judgment). Relevance judgments, when compared to case judgments, were accompanied by activation of the left inferior frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate. A separate region of the medial prefrontal cortex was selectively engaged during self-referential processing. Collectively, these findings suggest that self-referential processing is functionally dissociable from other forms of semantic processing within the human brain.},

	abstract = {One of the archetypal task manipulations known to depend on frontal-lobe function is reversal learning, where a dominant response must be overridden due to changes in the contingencies relating stimuli, responses, and environmental feedback. Previous studies have indicated that the lateral prefrontal cortex ({LPFC}), the lateral orbitofrontal cortex ({LOFC}), the anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), and the caudate nucleus ({CN}) all contribute to reversal learning. However, the exact contributions that they make during this cognitively complex task remain poorly defined. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examine which of the cognitive processes that contribute to the performance of a reversal best predicts the pattern of activation within distinct sub-regions of the frontal lobes. We demonstrate that during reversal learning the {LOFC} is particularly sensitive to the implementation of the reversal, whereas the {LPFC} is recruited more generally during attentional control. By contrast, the {ACC} and {CN} respond when new searches are initiated regardless of whether the previous response is available, whilst medial orbitofrontal cortex ({MOFC}) activity is correlated with the positive affect of feedback. These results accord well with the hypothesis that distinct components of adaptable behaviour are supported by anatomically distinct components of the executive system.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of obstructive sleep apnea ({OSA}) on procedural and declarative memory encoding in the evening prior to sleep, on memory consolidation during subsequent sleep, and on retrieval in the morning after sleep. {METHODS}: Memory performance (procedural mirror-tracing task, declarative visual and verbal memory task) and general neuropsychological performance were assessed before and after one night of polysomnographic monitoring in 15 patients with moderate {OSA} and 20 age-, sex-, and {IQ}-matched healthy subjects. {RESULTS}: Encoding levels prior to sleep were similar across groups for all tasks. Conventional analyses of averaged mirror tracing performance suggested a significantly reduced overnight improvement in {OSA} patients. Single trial analyses, however, revealed that this effect was due to significantly flattened learning curves in the evening and morning session in {OSA} patients. {OSA} patients showed a significantly lower verbal retention rate and a non-significantly reduced visual retention rate after sleep compared to healthy subjects. Polysomnography revealed a significantly reduced {REM} density, increased frequency of micro-arousals, elevated apnea-hypopnea index, and subjectively disturbed sleep quality in {OSA} patients compared to healthy subjects. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that moderate {OSA} is associated with a significant impairment of procedural and verbal declarative memory. Future work is needed to further determine the contribution of structural or functional alterations in brain circuits relevant for memory, and to test whether {OSA} treatment improves or normalizes the observed deficits in learning.},

We will attempt to place this network in the context of dynamical systems models which involve feedback and feedforward circuits with special attention to negative feedback mechanisms, inhibitory processes, and their role in response selection. From a systems perspective, inhibitory processes can be viewed as negative feedback circuits that allow for the interruption of ongoing behavior and the re-deployment of resources to other tasks. When these negative feedback mechanisms are compromised, positive feedback loops may develop as a result (of dis-inhibition). From this perspective, the relative sympathetic activation seen in anxiety disorders may represent dis-inhibition due to faulty inhibitory mechanisms.},

To identify mirror neurons in the inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}) of humans, we used a repetition suppression paradigm while measuring neural activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging.

This pattern of responses is consistent with that predicted by mirror neurons and is evidence of mirror neurons in the human {IFG}.},

To identify the year-by-year timing of developmental trends from late childhood (age 10) to early adulthood (age 20), the authors examined Big Five self-report data from a large and diverse Internet sample. At younger ages within this range, there were large individual differences in acquiescent responding, and acquiescence variability had pronounced effects on psychometric characteristics. Beyond the effects of acquiescence, self-reports generally became more coherent within domains, and better differentiated across domains, at older ages. Importantly, however, different Big Five domains showed different developmental trends. Extraversion showed especially pronounced age gains in coherence but no gains in differentiation. In contrast, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness showed large age gains in differentiation but only trivial gains in coherence. Neuroticism and Openness showed moderate gains in both coherence and differentiation. Comparisons of items that were relatively easy versus difficult to comprehend indicated that these patterns were not simply due to verbal comprehension. These findings have important implications for the study of personality characteristics and other psychological attributes in childhood and adolescence.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

Serotonergic system contributes to the regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. In humans, serotonergic agonists increase {PRL}, {ACTH}, and cortisol, while serotonin (5HT) influence on {GH} is controversial. Central 5HT activity and neuroendocrine function change during lifespan.


{DESIGN}

To clarify the neuroendocrine response to 5HT across lifespan, we assessed {ACTH}, cortisol, {DHEA}, {PRL}, and {GH} responses to citalopram ({CT}) in young adults ({YA}) (no.=12, 29.2±1.7 yr mean±{SEM}), middle aged ({MA}) (no.=12, 54.3±0.9 yr), and elderly ({ES}) (no.=12, 69.3±0.9 yr) males. All the subjects received placebo (saline iv over 120 min) or {CT} (20 mg iv over 120 min). Blood samples were taken every 15 min up to 240 min.


{RESULTS}

During placebo, {ACTH}, cortisol, {GH}, and {PRL} were similar in all groups while {DHEA} showed an age-dependent reduction from middle age (p{\textless}0.001). During {CT}, {ACTH}, and cortisol were higher than during placebo in {YA} (p{\textless}0.05) and even more in {MA} (p{\textless}0.01 vs placebo, p{\textless}0.05 vs {YA}); in {ES}, the increase of both {ACTH} and cortisol (p{\textless}0.05 vs placebo) was lower than in {MA} (p{\textless}0.05) and higher than in {YA} (p{\textless}0.05 for cortisol only). No changes were observed for {DHEA}, {GH}, and {PRL} in any group.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Corticotrope response to {CT} is age-dependent in normal men, being amplified starting from middle age, suggesting precocious changes in the serotonergic neuroendocrine control during lifespan. {CT} is a useful tool to evaluate the age-dependent serotonergic function in humans.},

Effective mental functioning requires that cognition be protected from emotional conflict due to interference by task-irrelevant emotionally salient stimuli. The neural mechanisms by which the brain detects and resolves emotional conflict are still largely unknown, however. Drawing on the classic Stroop conflict task, we developed a protocol that allowed us to dissociate the generation and monitoring of emotional conflict from its resolution. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), we find that activity in the amygdala and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices reflects the amount of emotional conflict. By contrast, the resolution of emotional conflict is associated with activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Activation of the rostral cingulate is predicted by the amount of previous-trial conflict-related neural activity and is accompanied by a simultaneous and correlated reduction of amygdalar activity. These data suggest that emotional conflict is resolved through top-down inhibition of amygdalar activity by the rostral cingulate cortex.},

Numerous methodological and technical challenges impede the production of natural social interaction within an Magnetic Resonance Imaging environment under controlled conditions. To overcome the obstacle, we chose a simple format of social interaction, namely “interactive imitation” through a double-video system. We registered blood oxygen level–dependent activity of 23 participants during 2 imitative conditions: free (F) and instructed (I) episodes of imitating (i) and of being imitated (bi). In addition to the areas classically reported in instructed imitation tasks, 2 activation patterns were found, which differentiate the subconditions. Firstly, brain areas involved during decisional and attentional processes (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , dorsal part of anterior cingulate gyrus [{dACC}], pre-{SMA}) were activated during all conditions except for instructed imitation—classically used in neuroimaging studies of imitation. Second, a greater activation in {dACC} and insula combined with an increased deactivation in the default mode network was observed when subjects were imitated compared with when they imitated. We suggest that these 2 patterns reflect the anticipation of the other's behavior and the engagement with others required by social interaction.},

	abstract = {David A. Kenny's pioneering contribution takes a social relations approach to basic questions of person perception in social interaction. Enlightening and provocative, this volume provides a comprehensive theoretical overview of "interpersonal perception," a field of research that holds great promise for shedding light on social behavior. Blending meticulous analysis with thoughtful interpretation, the book demonstrates how interpersonal perception enhances the traditional study of person perception by capturing the richness of social behavior.To introduce the topic, Kenny clearly explicates the differences between person perception and interpersonal perception, showing that while the traditional paradigm is guided by descriptions of hypothetical people, interpersonal perception takes into account the bidirectional reality of dyadic interaction. The book addresses three fundamentally different types of perceptions:  * How we see other people  * How we see ourselves  * How we think we are seen by others Nine different questions are based on the relationships among these perceptions. To answer these questions, the author sets forth the Social Relations Model, a research paradigm that posits people as both perceivers and targets. The model is flexible in that it allows for the possibility of meta- and self-perception, and it considers the impact of particular interactions with another on an individual's behavioral changes. The collection, interpretation, analysis, and summary of data are covered here in depth.The main body of the work examines specific theoretical issues within interpersonal perception. Devoting one chapter to each issue--labeled assimilation, consensus, uniqueness, reciprocity, target accuracy, assumed reciprocity, meta-accuracy, assumed similarity, and self-other agreement--Kenny presents the relevant research evidence for each one. The book concludes with a synthesis of the major issues, an examination of the links between behavior and perception, and a discussion of the insights the available evidence can yield about social relations.This unique volume is invaluable reading for all social scientists interested in person perception. Offering the first available overview of this significant new field of research, Interpersonal Perception is also an important text for courses on the subject.},

In particular, ventral {mPFC} is associated with inferences about one’s own self, whereas dorsal {mPFC} is associated with inferences about another individual. In the present functional {MRI} study we examined self-projection using a novel camera technology, which employs a sensor and timer to automatically take hundreds of photographs when worn, in order to create dynamic visuospatial cues taken from a first-person perspective. This allowed us to ask participants to self-project into the personal past or into the life of another person. We predicted that self-projection to the personal past would elicit greater activity in the ventral {mPFC}, whereas self-projection of another perspective would rely on dorsal {mPFC}. There were three main findings supporting this prediction. First, we found that self-projection to the personal past recruited greater ventral {mPFC}, whereas observing another person’s perspective recruited dorsal {mPFC}. Second, activity in ventral vs. dorsal {mPFC} was sensitive to parametric modulation on each trial by the ability to relive the personal past or to understand another’s perspective, respectively. Third, task-related functional connectivity analysis revealed that ventral {mPFC} contributed to the medial temporal lobe network linked to memory processes, whereas dorsal {mPFC} contributed to the frontoparietal network linked to controlled processes. In sum, these results suggest that ventral-dorsal subregions of the anterior midline are functionally dissociable and may differentially contribute to self-projection of self vs. other.},

In 4 experiments, participants were given the opportunity to behave dishonestly, and thus earn undeserved money, by over-reporting their performance on an ability-based task. Before the task, they were exposed to moral rules (i.e., an honor code). Those who cheated were more likely to forget the moral rules after behaving dishonestly, even though they were equally likely to remember morally irrelevant information (Experiment 1). Furthermore, people showed moral forgetting only after cheating could be enacted but not before cheating (Experiment 2), despite monetary incentives to recall the rules accurately (Experiment 3). Finally, moral forgetting appears to result from decreased access to moral rules after cheating (Experiment 4).},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, many neuroimaging studies have assessed the human brain networks underlying action observation and imitation using a variety of tasks and paradigms. Nevertheless, questions concerning which areas consistently contribute to these networks irrespective of the particular experimental design and how such processing may be lateralized remain unresolved. The current study aimed at identifying cortical areas consistently involved in action observation and imitation by combining activation likelihood estimation ({ALE}) meta-analysis with probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps. Meta-analysis of 139 functional magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography experiments revealed a bilateral network for both action observation and imitation. Additional subanalyses for different effectors within each network revealed highly comparable activation patterns to the overall analyses on observation and imitation, respectively, indicating an independence of these findings from potential confounds. Conjunction analysis of action observation and imitation meta-analyses revealed a bilateral network within frontal premotor, parietal, and temporo-occipital cortex. The most consistently rostral inferior parietal area was {PFt}, providing evidence for a possible homology of this region to macaque area {PF}. The observation and imitation networks differed particularly with respect to the involvement of Broca's area: whereas both networks involved a caudo-dorsal part of {BA} 44, activation during observation was most consistent in a more rostro-dorsal location, i.e., dorsal {BA} 45, while activation during imitation was most consistent in a more ventro-caudal aspect, i.e., caudal {BA} 44. The present meta-analysis thus summarizes and amends previous descriptions of the human brain networks related to action observation and imitation.},

The present study examined mental well-being, utilising the full range of certainty of belief or non-belief in God. In the first study, we compared church and secular group members on measures of life satisfaction and emotional stability. The second study used a large survey of the non-religious. A curvilinear relationship was found such that those with higher belief certainty (both confidently religious and atheists) have greater well-being relative to those with low certainty (unsure and agnostics). Multiple regressions controlling for social and demographic variables reduced, but did not eliminate this curvilinear relationship. Mechanisms of well-being may involve a confident worldview rather than religious beliefs themselves.},

However, an influential observational study of children's moral behavior, conducted by Hartshorne, May, and colleagues in the 1920s, suggested that consistency in morality-related behavior was lower than many people expected. Some psychologists interpreted such results to mean that there was no consistency in moral behavior and thus that there were no stable, meaningful individual differences in moral behavior – character did not exist. Recent years have witnessed a reinvigoration of character, ethics, and morality as objects of psychological study. Our purpose in this paper is to contribute to this reinvigoration by reviewing the use of the concept of “character” within psychology, considering whether the evidence supports the notion of moral character as a psychological construct, and suggesting new prospects for research on moral character.},

These parametric methods, however, have two major drawbacks. First, it is assumed that the observed data are Gaussian distributed and independent; assumptions that generally are not valid for {fMRI} data. Second, the statistical test distribution can be derived theoretically only for very simple linear detection statistics. With nonparametric statistical methods, the two limitations described above can be overcome. The major drawback of non-parametric methods is the computational burden with processing times ranging from hours to days, which so far have made them impractical for routine use in single-subject {fMRI} analysis. In this work, it is shown how the computational power of cost-efficient graphics processing units ({GPUs}) can be used to speed up random permutation tests. A test with 10000 permutations takes less than a minute, making statistical analysis of advanced detection methods in {fMRI} practically feasible. To exemplify the permutation-based approach, brain activity maps generated by the general linear model ({GLM}) and canonical correlation analysis ({CCA}) are compared at the same significance level.},

This study investigated whether the neural processing of internal body state (interoception) is associated with empathy, the understanding of the affective states of others. We used the ‘heartbeat-evoked potential’ ({HEP}), a surface electroencephalography ({EEG}) pattern, as a neural index of interoceptive processing. The {HEP} is contingent on the most prominent peak (R-wave) of the electrocardiogram ({ECG}) and is thought to reflect cortical processing of cardiac afferent input. Twenty-one healthy adults performed empathy and control tasks while {EEG} and {ECG} were recorded, where they made judgments based on either the affective or physical aspects of images of human eyes. {HEP}, {ECG} and heart rate in each task block were calculated and compared. Results showed that cardiac activity was not significantly different between tasks. In contrast, {HEP} showed a significant task difference, exhibited as an increased negativity during the empathy task over frontocentral sites at a latency of approximately 250–430 ms. Furthermore, a self-reported measure of empathy was associated with mean {HEP} amplitude during the period of task-related differentiation. These results suggest that afferent feedback from visceral activity may contribute to inferences about the affective state of others.},

Associations between a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene and amygdala activation have been found in healthy, depressed, and anxious adults. This study explored these gene-brain associations in adolescents by examining predictive effects of serotonin transporter gene variants (S and {LG} allele carriers vs. {LA} allele homozygotes) and their interaction with diagnosis (healthy vs. patients) on amygdala responses to emotional faces.Methods
Functional magnetic resonance data were collected from 33 healthy adolescents (mean age: 13.71, 55\% female) and 31 medication-free adolescents with current anxiety or depressive disorders (or both; mean age: 13.58, 56\% female) while viewing fearful, angry, happy, and neutral facial expressions under varying attention states.Results
A significant three-way genotype-by-diagnosis-by-face-emotion interaction characterized right amygdala activity while subjects monitored internal fear levels. This interaction was decomposed to map differential gene-brain associations in healthy and affected adolescents. First, consistent with healthy adult data, healthy adolescents with at least one copy of the S or {LG} allele showed stronger amygdala responses to fearful faces than healthy adolescents without these alleles. Second, patients with two copies of the {LA} allele exhibited greater amygdala responses to fearful faces relative to patients with S or {LG} alleles. Third, although weaker, genotype differences on amygdala responses in patients extended to happy faces. All effects were restricted to the fear-monitoring attention state.Conclusions
S/{LG} alleles in healthy adolescents, as in healthy adults, predict enhanced amygdala activation to fearful faces. Contrary findings of increased activation in patients with {LALA} relative to the S or {LG} alleles require further exploration.},

However, so far {PD} and conventional ({CONV}) application of antidepressants have never been directly compared for an extended period. We performed a double-blind study of {PD} and {CONV} application of doxepin ({DOX}) in depressed patients. After a 1-week placebo treatment, nine parents in the {PD} group received 250 mg of {DOX} every 6 days and placebo on the other days until day 39. Ten patients in the {CONV} group received increasing dosages of {DOX} until day 7 and 250 mg {DOX} on the other days for 39 days. Three dexamethasone ({DEX})-suppression/corticotropin-releasing hormone ({CRH})-stimulation tests were completed: (1)during the initial placebo period; (2)on day 9; and (3)on day 21. In the {PD} group, scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ({HAM}-D) differed from baseline only after day 36 (17.1 +/- 7.0 vs. 22.7 +/- 2.8, p {\textless} 0.03). In the {CONV} group, however, {HAM}-D scores improved significantly after 2 days (22.8 +/- 7.2 vs. 26.5 +/- 5.7, p {\textless} 0.02) and continued to improve until day 39 (7.3 +/- 5.8). From day 25 to 39, there were significant differences between the {HAM}-D scores of the two groups. In the {PD} group, the decline of cortisol after {DEX} pretreatment was nonsignificant ({NS}) at both follow-up test occasions (35.9 +/- 40.7 vs. 24.0 +/- 20.7 vs. 23.6 +/- 26.6 micrograms/{mL}). In the {CONV} group, a significant decrease was observed at the second test (61.8 +/- 61.9 vs. 10.7 +/- 4.2 vs. 19.8 +/- 19 micrograms/{mL}, p {\textless} 0.05, respectively, {NS}). The area-under-the-curve cortisol response after {CRH} was attenuated in the {PD} group (5,667 +/- 2,910 vs. 1,883 +/- 2,178 vs. 2,239 +/- 2,583 [arbitrary unit], p {\textless} 0.01, respectively, p {\textless} 0.01) and in the {CONV} group (5,710 +/- 4,734 vs. 1,267 +/- 2,053 vs. 445 +/- 1,016 [arbitrary unit], {NS}, respectively, p {\textless} 0.02.

	note = {In several recent investigations it could be demonstrated that the free cortisol response to awakening can serve as an useful index of the adrenocortical activity. When measured with strict reference to the time of awakening the assessment of this endocrine response is able to uncover subtle changes in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis activity, which are, for instance, related to persisting pain, burnout and chronic stress. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the {HPA} axis might serve as an indicator of allostatic load in subjects exposed to prolonged environmental noise. In the present paper four separate studies with a total of 509 adult subjects were combined in order to provide reliable information on normal values for the free cortisol response to awakening. Corresponding with earlier findings, a mean cortisol increase of about 50\% within the first 30 minutes after awakening was observed. The intraindividual stability over time was shown to be remarkably high with correlations up to r=.63 (for the area under the response curve). Furthermore, the cortisol rise after awakening is rather consistent, with responder rates of about 75\%. Gender significantly influenced early morning free cortisol levels. Although women showed a virtually identical cortisol increase after awakening compared to men, a significantly delayed decrease was observed. Confirming and extending previous findings, the present study strongly suggests that neither age, nor the use of oral contraceptives, habitual smoking, time of awakening, sleep duration or using / not using an alarm clock have a considerable impact on free cortisol levels after awakening. The cortisol awakening response can be assessed under a wide variety of clinical and field settings, since it is non-invasive, inexpensive and easy-to-employ. The present data provide normal values and information on potential confounds which should facilitate investigations into the endocrine consequences of prolonged exposure to environmental noise.},

The serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) has long been considered likely to play a role in autism. Hyperserotonemia has been consistently found in a proportion of autistic patients, and the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}) can have a positive effect in treating some symptoms of autism. Specific variants of the 5-{HTT} gene, {SLC}6A4, especially the insertion-deletion 5-{HTTLPR} promoter locus, have been found to modulate its expression and transporter function.Methods
We examined the transmission of the short or long allele of 5-{HTTLPR} locus to affected individuals, using a large cohort of 352 families. In addition, we screened five single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in the 5' region of {SLC}6A4 previously reported to be positively associated with autism, as well as 4 additional {SNPs} also in the 5' region.Results
No association of the 5-{HTTLPR} locus with autism was found. Furthermore, no evidence for association of any of the nine {SNPs} covering the {SLC}6A4 gene, or any of their haplotypes, was observed in our study. Using obsessive-compulsive behaviors ({OCB}), severe {OCBs} or rigid-compulsive subsets of our cohort gave the same negative results.Conclusions
{SLC}6A4 variants do not appear to be significantly involved in the liability to autism.},

A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of {fMRI} responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject {fMRI} setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in {BOLD} signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all {fMRI} studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies.},

	abstract = {A great deal of research has examined behavioral performance changes associated with second language learning. But what changes are taking place in the brain as learning progresses? How can we identify differences in brain changes that reflect successes of learning? To answer these questions, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study to examine the neural activities associated with second language word learning. Participants were 39 native English speakers who had no prior knowledge of Chinese or other tonal language, and were trained to learn a novel tonal vocabulary in a six-week training session. Functional {MRI} scans as well as behavioral performances were obtained from these learners at two different times (pre- and post-training). We performed region of interest ({ROI}) and connectivity analyses to identify effective connectivity changes associated with success in second language word learning. We compared a learner group with a control group, and also examined the differences between successful learners and less successful learners within the learner group across the two time points. Our results indicated that (1) after training, learners and non-learners rely on different patterns of brain networks to process tonal and lexical information of target L2 words; (2) within the learner group, successful learners compared to less successful learners showed significant differences in language-related regions; and (3) successful learners compared to less successful learners showed a more coherent and integrated multi-path brain network. These results suggest that second language experience shapes neural changes in short-term training, and that analyses of these neural changes also reflect individual differences in learning success.},

These beliefs remain strong, despite the fact that the empirical record on the issue has remained equivocal for over a century. In this research, the authors examined one reason for this situation: People essentialize emotion categories by assuming that members of the same category (e.g., fear) have a shared metaphysical essence (i.e., a common causal mechanism). In Study 1, the authors found that lay people essentialize emotions by assuming that instances of the same emotion category have a shared essence that defines them, even when their surface features differ. Study 2 extended these findings, demonstrating that lay people tend to essentialize categories the more a category is of the body (vs. the mind). In Study 3, we examined the links between emotion essentialism and the complexity of actual emotional experiences. In particular, we predicted and found that individuals who hold essentialist beliefs about emotions describe themselves as experiencing highly differentiated emotional experiences but do not show evidence of stronger emotional differentiation in their momentary ratings of experience in everyday life. Implications for the science of emotion are discussed.},

Morphometrical analyses showed reduced gray matter volume in short-allele carriers in limbic regions critical for processing of negative emotion, particularly perigenual cingulate and amygdala. Functional analysis of those regions during perceptual processing of fearful stimuli demonstrated tight coupling as a feedback circuit implicated in the extinction of negative affect. Short-allele carriers showed relative uncoupling of this circuit. Furthermore, the magnitude of coupling inversely predicted almost 30\% of variation in temperamental anxiety.

Twelve hours later, after sleeping or staying awake, subjects performed a recognition test requiring them to discriminate between these original pictures and novel pictures by responding "remember,"know" (familiar), or "new." Selective sleep effects were observed for consolidation of emotional memory: Recognition accuracy for know judgments of arousing stimuli improved by 42\% after sleep relative to wake, and recognition bias for remember judgments of these stimuli increased by 58\% after sleep relative to wake (resulting in more conservative responding).

Parents reported on their emotional characteristics and parenting; children (5 to 13 years old; 42\% girls) also described parenting practices. Children's age and parenting factors accounted for an average of 32\% of the variance in child emotional factors, which, with role-taking, strongly predicted children's empathy. In contrast to earlier, less comprehensive studies, we found important paths between parents’ and children's empathy, mediated by children's anger. These countervailing pathways largely neutralized each other, resulting in the low correlations usually seen when parents’ and children's empathy are examined in isolation. Thus our findings are an important confirmation and extension of the theoretically expected link between parents’ and children's empathy.},

A population-based study has been conducted on 5-{HTTLPR} with 358 individuals, which included 79 autistic probands, 136 parents, and 143 controls from two subpopulations of east and northeast regions of India. The genotypic frequencies of all the groups conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. With the finding of efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in ameliorating ritualistic behavior in autistic disorder, 5-{HTT} emerged as a putative candidate gene for autism and association studies have been carried out in different ethnic populations. But these studies were inconclusive due to conflicting results on association. Because such a study has never been performed in the Indian population, we have tested the possible involvement of 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphism with autism. The present study failed to establish any association or linkage of 5-{HTTLPR} with autism in the Indian population by case-control studies ([chi]2 = 1.314, P = 0.63) and family-based approaches ({TDT} [chi]2 = 0.22, P = 0.64 and {HHRR}-[chi]2 = 0.25, P = 0.61). However, when a meta-analysis of all the available {TDT} data, inclusive of the present study is carried out, we observed a significant preferential transmission of S-allele from parents to the affected offspring ([chi]2 = 7.51, P = 0.006) indicating an association of 5-{HTTLPR} with autism.},

	abstract = {{AbstractPurpose}
To examine the relation between “sexting” (sending and sharing sexual photos online, via text messaging, and in person) with sexual risk behaviors and psychosocial challenge in adolescence.
Methods
Data were collected online between 2010 and 2011 with 3,715 randomly selected 13- to 18-year-old youth across the United States.
Results
Seven percent of youth reported sending or showing someone sexual pictures of themselves, in which they were nude or nearly nude, online, via text messaging, or in person, during the past year. Although females and older youth were more likely to share sexual photos than males and younger youth, the profile of psychosocial challenge and sexual behavior was similar for all youth. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, sharing sexual photos was associated with all types of sexual behaviors assessed (e.g., oral sex, vaginal sex) as well as some of the risky sexual behaviors examined—particularly having concurrent sexual partners and having more past-year sexual partners. Adolescents who shared sexual photos also were more likely to use substances and less likely to have high self-esteem than their demographically similar peers.
Conclusions
Although the media has portrayed sexting as a problem caused by new technology, health professionals may be more effective by approaching it as an aspect of adolescent sexual development and exploration and, in some cases, risk-taking and psychosocial challenge.},

	abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest ({ROIs}). Using a dataset of 40 {MRI} scans we manually identified 34 cortical {ROIs} in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label {ROIs}. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients ({ICC}), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of {ROIs}. When compared with the manual {ROIs}, the automated {ROIs} were highly accurate, with an average {ICC} of 0.835 across all of the {ROIs}, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of {ROIs}. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which {MRI}-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

	shorttitle = {Factor Analysis at 100},
	abstract = {Factor analysis is one of the success stories of statistics in the social sciences. The reason for its wide appeal is that it provides a way to investigate latent variables, the fundamental traits and concepts in the study of individual differences. Because of its importance, a conference was held to mark the centennial of the publication of Charles Spearman's seminal 1904 article which introduced the major elements of this invaluable statistical tool. This book evolved from that conference. It provides a retrospective look at major issues and developments as well as a prospective view of future directions in factor analysis and related methods. In so doing, it demonstrates how and why factor analysis is considered to be one of the methodological pillars of behavioral research.Featuring an outstanding collection of contributors, this volume offers unique insights on factor analysis and its related methods. Several chapters have a clear historical perspective, while others present new ideas along with historical summaries. In addition, the book reviews some of the extensions of factor analysis to such techniques as latent growth curve models, models for categorical data, and structural equation models. Factor Analysis at 100 will appeal to graduate students and researchers in the behavioral, social, health, and biological sciences who use this technique in their research. A basic knowledge of factor analysis is required and a working knowledge of linear algebra is helpful.},

	abstract = {Neuroscientists have become increasingly interested in exploring dynamic relationships among brain regions. Such a relationship, when directed from one region toward another, is denoted by “effective connectivity.” An {fMRI} experimental paradigm which is well-suited for examination of effective connectivity is the slow event-related design. This design presents stimuli at sufficient temporal spacing for determining within-trial trajectories of {BOLD} activation, allowing for the analysis of stimulus-locked temporal covariation of brain responses in multiple regions. This may be especially important for emotional stimuli processing, which can evolve over the course of several seconds, if not longer. However, while several methods have been devised for determining {fMRI} effective connectivity, few are adapted to event-related designs, which include nonstationary {BOLD} responses and multiple levels of nesting. We propose a model tailored for exploring effective connectivity of multiple brain regions in event-related {fMRI} designs — a semi-parametric adaptation of vector autoregressive ({VAR}) models, termed “stimulus-locked {VAR}” ({SloVAR}). Connectivity coefficients vary as a function of time relative to stimulus onset, are regularized via basis expansions, and vary randomly across subjects. {SloVAR} obtains flexible, data-driven estimates of effective connectivity and hence is useful for building connectivity models when prior information on dynamic regional relationships is sparse. Indices derived from the coefficient estimates can also be used to relate effective connectivity estimates to behavioral or clinical measures. We demonstrate the {SloVAR} model on a sample of clinically depressed and normal controls, showing that early but not late cortico–amygdala connectivity appears crucial to emotional control and early but not late cortico–cortico connectivity predicts depression severity in the depressed group, relationships that would have been missed in a more traditional {VAR} analysis.},

We investigated whether individual variation in the personality trait of identification is associated with individual variation in the structure of specific brain regions, using surface and volume-based morphometry. The hypothesized regions of interest were selected on the basis of their functional role in subserving the cognitive processing domains considered important for identification (i.e. mental imagery, empathy, theory of mind and merging) and for the immersive experience called ‘presence’. Controlling for age, sex, whole-brain volume and other traits, identification covaried significantly with the left hippocampal volume, cortical thickness in the right anterior insula and the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, and with gray matter volume in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that trait identification is associated with structural variation in specific brain regions. The findings are discussed in relation to the potential functional contribution of these regions to identification.},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical studies of endogenous concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone ({DHEA}) and its sulfated conjugate {DHEA}-S in depression are limited. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of successful pharmacological treatment of late-life depression on concentrations of {DHEA}, {DHEA}-S and cortisol.

Methods: We determined endogenous concentrations of {DHEA}, {DHEA}-S and cortisol in elderly control subjects (n = 16) and in elderly depressed patients who remitted (n = 44) or failed to remit (n = 16) with pharmacological treatment. Depressed patients were treated for 12 weeks with either nortriptyline or paroxetine.

Results: In remitters, {DHEA} and {DHEA}-S concentrations were lower at week 12 than at week 0 (p = .002 and p = .0001, respectively). In the nonremitters and control subjects, neither {DHEA} nor {DHEA}-S concentrations changed. Decreases in hormone concentrations were associated with improvement in mood and functioning in depressed patients. Although cortisol concentrations decreased in remitters and nonremitters, the change was not significant.

Conclusions: Our data suggest that the decrease in {DHEA} and {DHEA}-S in remitters is related to remission of depression rather than to a direct drug effect on steroids, as nonremitters had no change in hormone concentrations.},

	abstract = {Humans can regulate their emotional states through a number of effortful cognitive strategies, a type of adaptive behavior not found in animals. The best studied strategy is reappraisal which consists in deliberately changing the emotional interpretation of a stimulus. Reappraisal modulates both subjective and physiological emotional response components and has long-term effects on well-being and mental health. Over the past few years, a rapidly growing neuroimaging literature has attempted to characterize the neural mechanisms that mediate reappraisal, but results have so far been relatively inconsistent. This article provides an overview of the current state of the field and presents a first formal quantitative meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings. It introduces a new model of the cognitive processes underlying reappraisal which builds on a conceptualization of reappraisal as a temporally extended, dynamic process and partitions reappraisal episodes into an early implementation and a later maintenance stage. In agreement with the model, preliminary evidence from parametric meta-analysis suggests the two stages are supported by distinct frontal networks. Hypotheses for further research are presented.},

After laboratory-based neutral or compassion inductions, participants made abstract judgments about compassion relative to various emotion-related adjectives, thereby providing a prototypical conceptualization of compassion. Participants also rated their own affective states, thereby indicating experiences of compassion. Conceptualizations of compassion were pleasant across neutral and compassion inductions. After exposure to others’ suffering, however, participants felt increased levels of compassion and unpleasant affect, but not pleasant affect. After neutral inductions, participants reported more pleasant than unpleasant affect, with moderate levels of compassion. Thus, prototypical conceptualizations of compassion are pleasant, but experiences of compassion can feel pleasant or unpleasant. The implications for emotion theory in general are discussed.},

This comparison has proven to be deeply generative, as models of physical perception and social cognition have evolved in parallel. In this article, I propose extending this classic analogy in a new direction by proposing cue integration as a common feature of social cognition and physical perception. When encountering complex social cues—which happens often—perceivers use multiple processes for understanding others’ minds. Like physical senses (e.g., vision or audition), social cognitive processes have often been studied as though they operate in relative isolation. In the domain of physical perception, this assumption has broken down, following evidence that perception is instead characterized by pervasive integration of multisensory information. Such integration is, in turn, elegantly described by Bayesian inferential models. By adopting a similar cue integration framework, researchers can similarly understand and formally model the ways that we perceive others’ minds based on complex social information.},

	abstract = {The advent of functional neuroimaging has allowed tremendous advances in our understanding of brain–language relationships, in addition to generating substantial empirical data on this subject in the form of thousands of activation peak coordinates reported in a decade of language studies. We performed a large-scale meta-analysis of this literature, aimed at defining the composition of the phonological, semantic, and sentence processing networks in the frontal, temporal, and inferior parietal regions of the left cerebral hemisphere. For each of these language components, activation peaks issued from relevant component-specific contrasts were submitted to a spatial clustering algorithm, which gathered activation peaks on the basis of their relative distance in the {MNI} space. From a sample of 730 activation peaks extracted from 129 scientific reports selected among 260, we isolated 30 activation clusters, defining the functional fields constituting three distributed networks of frontal and temporal areas and revealing the functional organization of the left hemisphere for language. The functional role of each activation cluster is discussed based on the nature of the tasks in which it was involved. This meta-analysis sheds light on several contemporary issues, notably on the fine-scale functional architecture of the inferior frontal gyrus for phonological and semantic processing, the evidence for an elementary audio–motor loop involved in both comprehension and production of syllables including the primary auditory areas and the motor mouth area, evidence of areas of overlap between phonological and semantic processing, in particular at the location of the selective human voice area that was the seat of partial overlap of the three language components, the evidence of a cortical area in the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus dedicated to syntactic processing and in the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus a region selectively activated by sentence and text processing, and the hypothesis that different working memory perception–actions loops are identifiable for the different language components. These results argue for large-scale architecture networks rather than modular organization of language in the left hemisphere.},

If the {SPI} personality traits are representative of the domain of non-Big Five personality traits, then the major source of the variance in the {SPI} traits would be expected to correlate strongly with the sixth factor of personality, Honesty-Humility. We tested this hypothesis using self-report measures (N=200) of the {SPI} traits, of the Big Five, and of the new six-dimensional (“{HEXACO}”) structure. Results indicated that the first unrotated factor underlying the 10 {SPI} traits was heavily saturated with variance from Honesty-Humility (r=.65). Nevertheless, the 10 {SPI} traits contained substantial amounts of unique variance not accounted for by the {HEXACO} or the Big Five variables, highlighting the importance of the facet-level assessment of personality traits.},

	abstract = {In various models of sexual selection mediated by the viability indicator (“good genes”) mechanism, a sexually selected trait will truly reflect male quality if its expression is costly for the male. However, in long-lived species, the expression of a trait often increases with age while the genotype of the male remains unchanged. This fact may obscure the indicator mechanism. Hitherto, game theory models of honesty in sexual advertisement have not taken life-history effects into account, whereas life-history models of reproductive effort have only seldom considered the dependence of mating success on the actions of other individuals. Here, the two approaches are combined, and I examine whether honesty is maintained if males can divide their advertisement effort over their lifetime. The model shows that an increase in the expression of the sexually selected trait over several years is an evolutionarily stable strategy ({ESS}) under a wide range of situations, so that a correlated preference for old age can emerge through a viability indicator mechanism. Honesty in the strict sense is not preserved: an optimally behaving low-quality male will in some cases advertise more than a high-quality male of equal age, to the extent that the strongest advertisement found in the population can be associated with a low-quality male. Due to life-history trade-offs, however, honesty in an average sense holds true over the lifetime of individuals: “cheater” age classes will remain small enough, that a female will obtain a higher expected mate quality if she trusts in the trait as an indicator of viability.},

To investigate a possible association between genes regulating the {HPA} axis and response to antidepressants and susceptibility for depression, we genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms in eight of these genes in depressed individuals and matched controls. We found significant associations of response to antidepressants and the recurrence of depressive episodes with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in {FKBP}5, a glucocorticoid receptor-regulating cochaperone of hsp-90, in two independent samples. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also associated with increased intracellular {FKBP}5 protein expression, which triggers adaptive changes in glucocorticoid receptor and, thereby, {HPA}-axis regulation. Individuals carrying the associated genotypes had less {HPA}-axis hyperactivity during the depressive episode. We propose that the {FKBP}5 variant-dependent alterations in {HPA}-axis regulation could be related to the faster response to antidepressant drug treatment and the increased recurrence of depressive episodes observed in this subgroup of depressed individuals. These findings support a central role of genes regulating the {HPA} axis in the causality of depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs.},

	abstract = {Objective 
Changes in reward-related behavior are an important component of normal adolescent affective development. Understanding the neural underpinnings of these normative changes creates a foundation for investigating adolescence as a period of vulnerability to affective disorders, substance use disorders, and health problems. Studies of reward-related brain function have revealed conflicting findings regarding developmental change in the reactivity of the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) and have not considered puberty. The current study focused on puberty-specific changes in brain function and their association with mood. 
Method 
A sample of 77 healthy adolescents (26 pre-/early pubertal, 51 mid-/late pubertal) recruited in a narrow age range (mean = 11.94 years, {SD} = 0.75) were assessed for sexual maturation and circulating testosterone, completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) guessing task with monetary reward, and underwent experience sampling of mood in natural environments. For comparison, 19 healthy adults completed the {fMRI} assessment. 
Results 
Adolescents with more advanced pubertal maturation exhibited less striatal and more {mPFC} reactivity during reward outcome than similarly aged adolescents with less advanced maturation. Testosterone was positively correlated with striatal reactivity in boys during reward anticipation and negatively correlated with striatal reactivity in girls and boys during reward outcome. Striatal reactivity was positively correlated with real-world subjective positive affect and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. {mPFC} reactivity was positively correlated with depressive symptoms. 
Conclusions 
Reward-related brain function changes with puberty and is associated with adolescents' positive affect and depressive symptoms. Increased reward-seeking behavior at this developmental point could serve to compensate for these changes.},

In the present study, we attempted to determine whether harsh parental discipline occurring early in life was associated with later aggression and internalizing behavior in children, using a prospective design with randomly selected samples to avoid some of these methodological difficulties. Structural equation modeling indicated a consistent relation between harsh discipline and aggression in 2 separate cohorts of children. This relation did not appear to be due to possible confounding factors such as child temperament, {SES}, and marital violence, although there was some indication in our data that the latter variables were related to child aggression. In addition, our analyses suggested that the effect of harsh discipline on child aggression may be mediated at least in part by maladaptive social information processing patterns that develop in response to the harsh discipline.},

Both models partition variance in longitudinal data into trait and state components. In this chapter, the authors focus on these two models. Additionally, they show that the multitrait-multimethod matrix ({MTMM}; Campbell and Fiske, 1959) is relevant for the analysis of the matrix suggested by Kenny and Campbell (1989), that a preliminary {MTMM} analysis is helpful in determining how to proceed in the analysis of stability. These different models are evaluated in terms of the criteria: design, model conceptualization, model assumption plausibility, and estimation methods and difficulty. They illustrate each model's strengths and weakness through analysis of a secondary data set collected from 433 female adolescents measured 4 times at 6-mo intervals on the Center for Epidemiological Studies—Depression Scale.

	abstract = {While positive emotion can be conceptualized broadly as a response to the potential for reward, the environment offers different kinds of rewards, and these are best approached in somewhat different ways. A functional approach to positive emotion differentiation distinguishes among several different types of rewards with strong implications for adaptive fitness and posits the existence of “discrete” positive emotions that promote an adaptive response to each reward. A taxonomy of eight positive emotions, dubbed the “{PANACEAS}” taxonomy based on an acronym of the first letter of each of the eight constructs, is presented as an example of this approach. Positive emotion constructs defined through functional analyses are useful for guiding empirical research, especially for identifying prototypical eliciting stimuli, and generating hypotheses about the implications of different positive emotions for a variety of outcomes. Research findings are reviewed that support the importance of positive emotion differentiation in understanding the effects of positive emotions on cognition, physiology, and behavior. Advantages of the functional approach are discussed, as well as implications of the approach for evaluating major theories of the structure of emotion.},

Although prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the cognitive regulation of emotion, the cortical-subcortical interactions that mediate this ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we identified a right ventrolateral prefrontal region ({vlPFC}) whose activity correlated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. We then applied a pathway-mapping analysis on subcortical regions to locate mediators of the association between {vlPFC} activity and reappraisal success (i.e., reductions in reported emotion). Results identified two separable pathways that together explained ∼50\% of the reported variance in self-reported emotion: (1) a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success, and (2) a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success (i.e., more negative emotion). These results provide direct evidence that {vlPFC} is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotion through different subcortical pathways, suggesting a general role for this region in appraisal processes.},

Twelve children and 12 adults (average age = 10.2 and 26.1 years, respectively) reported whether short phrases described themselves or a highly familiar other (Harry Potter) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. In both children and adults, the {MPFC} was relatively more active during self- than social knowledge retrieval, and the {MPPC} was relatively more active during social than self-knowledge retrieval. Direct comparisons between children and adults indicated that children activated the {MPFC} during self-knowledge retrieval to a much greater extent than adults. The particular regions of the {MPPC} involved varied between the two groups, with the posterior precuneus engaged by adults, but the anterior precuneus and posterior cingulate engaged by children. Only children activated the {MPFC} significantly above baseline during self-knowledge retrieval.

Few differences in traditional health behaviors (e.g., smoking, exercise, nutrition) have been found to differentiate lonely and nonlonely individuals. We present evidence that a prototypic restorative behavior—sleep—does make such a differentiation, not through differences in time in bed or in sleep duration, but through differences in efficacy: In the study we report here, lonely individuals evinced poorer sleep efficiency and more time awake after sleep onset than nonlonely individuals. These results, which were observed in controlled laboratory conditions and were found to generalize to the home, suggest that lonely individuals may be less resilient than nonlonely individuals in part because they sleep more poorly. These results also raise the possibility that social factors such as loneliness not only may influence the selection of health behaviors but also may modulate the salubrity of restorative behaviors.},

In these conditions, it is likely that the full impact of the high glucocorticoid levels is felt on the brain, through over-stimulation of the glucocorticoid receptors ({GRs}); indeed, normalizing these high levels leads to an improvement of mood in these patients. However, a completely different mechanism may be operating in major depression, where the increased levels of glucocorticoid hormones are conceptualized as driven by an impairment in {GR} function (glucocorticoid resistance), and therefore as a “compensatory” mechanism. Moreover, clinical and experimental studies have shown that antidepressants increase {GR} function, thus leading to resolution of glucocorticoid resistance. Interestingly, a number of studies have also demonstrated that manipulating {GR} function with both agonists and antagonists has an antidepressant effect, and indeed that other drugs targeting the {HPA} axis and cortisol secretion—even drugs with opposite effects on the {HPA} axis—have antidepressant effects. These studies do not support the notion that “high levels of glucocorticoids” always have a depressogenic effect, nor that decreasing the effects of these hormones always has an antidepressant effects.},

Here we review functional brain imaging findings in major intrinsic sleep disorders (i.e., idiopathic insomnia, narcolepsy, and obstructive sleep apnea) and in abnormal motor behavior during sleep (i.e., periodic limb movement disorder and {REM} sleep behavior disorder). The studies reviewed include neuroanatomical assessments (voxel-based morphometry, magnetic resonance spectroscopy), metabolic/functional investigations (positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), and ligand marker measurements.

Based on the current state of the research, we suggest that brain imaging is a useful approach to assess the structural and functional correlates of sleep impairments as well as better understand the cerebral consequences of various therapeutic approaches. Modern neuroimaging techniques therefore provide a valuable tool to gain insight into possible pathophysiological mechanisms of sleep disorders in adult humans.},

Total cortisol {AUC} was a summary measure of cumulative cortisol exposure. Higher {CAR} was associated with significantly lower wake-up cortisol (β = −0.56; 95\% {CI}: −0.59 to −0.53) and a higher early decline {AUC} (β = 0.38; 95\% {CI}: 0.34–0.42) but was not associated with total cortisol {AUC} (β = 0.04; 95\% {CI}: −0.01 to 0.09), or other diurnal cortisol curve components following multivariable adjustment. Total cortisol {AUC} was significantly and positively associated with wake-up cortisol (β = 0.36; 95\% {CI}: 0.32–0.40), bedtime cortisol (β = 0.61; 95\% {CI}: 0.58–0.64), and other {AUC} measures, following multivariable adjustment. Associations were similar by sex, race/ethnicity, and age categories. We conclude that bedtime cortisol showed the strongest correlation with total cortisol {AUC}, suggesting it may be a marker of daily cortisol exposure.},

Forty-one studies with 6,017 participants were included in the analysis. Ten studies concerned representative samples from the general population, 24 studies compared nonaggressive to extremely aggressive nonreferred samples, and 7 studies compared nonreferred samples with children referred for aggressive behavior problems. A robust significant association between hostile attribution of intent and aggressive behavior was found. Effect sizes differed considerably between studies. Larger effects were associated with more severe aggressive behavior, rejection by peers as one of the selection criteria, inclusion of 8- to-12-year-old participants, and absence of control for intelligence. Video and picture presentation of stimuli were associated with smaller effect sizes than was audio presentation. Staging of actual social interactions was associated with the largest effects. The importance of understanding moderators of effect size for theory development is stressed.},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization, registration, and segmentation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI}) often use a target or template volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information, and define a common coordinate system for analysis. In the neuroimaging literature, the {MNI}305 Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations, variation from the adult brain makes the {MNI}305 suboptimal for processing brain images of children. Morphological changes occurring during development render the use of age-appropriate templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased, age-appropriate {MRI} atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5–18.5 years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal) sample of the U.S. population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry study using 66 young (4.5–6.9 years) participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates. The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of pediatric {MRI} data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.},

	abstract = {Abstract: A truly remarkable aspect of human existence is the unitary sense of self that exists across time and place. Understanding the nature of self—what it is and what it does—has challenged scholars since antiquity. How can empirical research measure what it is to have a sense of self? We propose that the sense of self may emerge from the functions of a left hemisphere “interpreter” (Gazzaniga, 2000). First, we examine evidence for the existence of self-processing mechanisms in the intact brain, from behavioral and functional neuroimaging research. The available evidence suggests that the sense of self is widely distributed throughout the brain. Second, we discuss these findings in relation to what is known about higher cognitive functions in humans who have undergone a surgical procedure to sever the connection between the two cerebral hemispheres. Split-brain research has facilitated an understanding of the way in which each cerebral hemisphere independently processes information. Research in this area has shown that each cerebral hemisphere features distinct information-processing capabilities. This cognitive asymmetry is reflected in the notion of a left hemisphere interpreter module which, we have argued, generates a unitary sense of consciousness even in the disconnected brain. This chapter describes how this interpreter may also give rise to a unified sense of self.},

Power approximations following the method of Satorra and Saris (1985) were used to evaluate the power to detect slope covariances. Even with large samples (N=500) and several longitudinal occasions (4 or 5), statistical power to detect covariance of slopes was moderate to low unless growth curve reliability at study onset was above .90. Studies using {LGCMs} may fail to detect slope correlations because of low power rather than a lack of relationship of change between variables.

In particular, I address issues related to (1) model parameterization (modeling baseline or null events) and scaling of the design matrix; (2) hemodynamic modeling using basis functions, and (3) computing percentage signal change. Using a simple controlled block design and an alternating block design, I first show why “baseline” should not be modeled (model over-parameterization), and how this affects effect sizes. I also show that, depending on what is tested; over-parameterization does not necessarily impact upon statistical results. Next, using a simple periodic vs. random event related design, I show how the hemodynamic model (hemodynamic function only or using derivatives) can affects parameter estimates, as well as detail the role of orthogonalization. I then relate the above results to the computation of percentage signal change. Finally, I discuss how these issues affect group analyses and give some recommendations.},

We argue that researchers have a duty to describe sampling decisions they make; without such descriptions, self-correction becomes difficult, if not impossible. We developed the Replicability and Meta-Analytic Suitability Inventory ({RAMSI}) to evaluate the descriptive adequacy of a sample of studies taken from current psychological literature. Authors described only about 30\% of the sampling decisions necessary for self-correcting science. We suggest that a modified {RAMSI} can be used by authors to guide their written reports and by reviewers to inform editorial recommendations. Finally, we claim that when researchers do not describe their sampling decisions, both readers and reviewers may assume that those decisions do not matter to the outcome of the study, do not affect inferences made from the research findings, do not inhibit inclusion in meta-analyses, and do not inhibit replicability of the study. If these assumptions are in error, as they often are, and the neglected decisions are relevant, then the neglect may create a good deal of mischief in the field.},

The neuroendocrine and cerebral metabolic response to the acute administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (40\&\#xa0;mg, {IV}), was measured in 17 normal control subjects using positron emission tomography ({PET}) to evaluate changes in serotonin function with normal aging. The citalopram-induced change in cerebral metabolism was positively correlated with age in the right precuneus, right paracentral lobule, and left middle temporal gyrus and negatively correlated with age in the left anterior cingulate gyrus, right inferior and middle frontal gyri, right insula, and right inferior parietal lobule. The positive correlations in mainly posterior brain regions indicate that normal aging is associated with an increase in metabolism after citalopram administration, whereas the negative correlations in mainly anterior brain regions indicate that normal aging is associated with a greater decrease in metabolism. These results suggest different compensatory processes in anterior compared to posterior brain regions secondary to the age-related loss of serotonin innervation.},

Inspection of the literature, however, reveals that the effects of oxytocin in the social domain are often weak and/or inconsistent. We propose that this literature can be informed by an interactionist approach in which the effects of oxytocin are constrained by features of situations and/or individuals. We show how this approach can improve understanding of extant research, suggest novel mechanisms through which oxytocin might operate, and refine predictions about oxytocin pharmacotherapy.},

	abstract = {Neuroanatomy places critical constraints on the functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex. To analyze these constraints we have examined the relationship between structural features of networks (expressed as graphs) and the patterns of functional connectivity to which they give rise when implemented as dynamical systems. We selected among structurally varying graphs using as selective criteria a number of global information-theoretical measures that characterize functional connectivity. We selected graphs separately for increases in measures of entropy (capturing statistical independence of graph elements), integration (capturing their statistical dependence) and complexity (capturing the interplay between their functional segregation and integration). We found that dynamics with high complexity were supported by graphs whose units were organized into densely linked groups that were sparsely and reciprocally interconnected. Connection matrices based on actual neuroanatomical data describing areas and pathways of the macaque visual cortex and the cat cortex showed structural characteristics that coincided best with those of such complex graphs, revealing the presence of distinct but interconnected anatomical groupings of areas. Moreover, when implemented as dynamical systems, these cortical connection matrices generated functional connectivity with high complexity, characterized by the presence of highly coherent functional clusters. We also found that selection of graphs as they responded to input or produced output led to increases in the complexity of their dynamics. We hypothesize that adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands requires complex dynamics and that these dynamics are supported by neuroanatomical motifs that are characteristic of the cerebral cortex.},

Two {fMRI} studies provide converging evidence that individuals lower in social status are more likely to engage neural circuitry often involved in ‘mentalizing’ or thinking about others' thoughts and feelings. Study 1 found that college students' perception of their social status in the university community was related to neural activity in the mentalizing network (e.g., {DMPFC}, {MPFC}, precuneus/{PCC}) while encoding social information, with lower social status predicting greater neural activity in this network. Study 2 demonstrated that socioeconomic status, an objective indicator of global standing, predicted adolescents' neural activity during the processing of threatening faces, with individuals lower in social status displaying greater activity in the {DMPFC}, previously associated with mentalizing, and the amygdala, previously associated with emotion/salience processing. These studies demonstrate that social status is fundamentally and neurocognitively linked to how people process and navigate their social worlds.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, empathy research has blossomed into a vibrant and multidisciplinary field of study. The social neuroscience approach to the subject is premised on the idea that studying empathy at multiple levels (biological, cognitive, and social) will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how other people's thoughts and feelings can affect our own thoughts, feelings, and behavior. In these cutting-edge contributions, leading advocates of the multilevel approach view empathy from the perspectives of social, cognitive, developmental, and clinical psychology and cognitive/affective neuroscience.Chapters include a critical examination of the various definitions of the empathy construct; surveys of major research traditions based on these differing views (including empathy as emotional contagion, as the projection of one's own thoughts and feelings, and as a fundamental aspect of social development); clinical and applied perspectives, including psychotherapy and the study of empathy for other people's pain; various neuroscience perspectives; and discussions of empathy's evolutionary and neuroanatomical histories, with a special focus on neuroanatomical continuities and differences across the phylogenetic spectrum.The new discipline of social neuroscience bridges disciplines and levels of analysis. In this volume, the contributors' state-of-the-art investigations of empathy from a social neuroscience perspective vividly illustrate the potential benefits of such cross-disciplinary integration.Contributors: C.

	abstract = {Background Increased autism prevalence rates have generated considerable concern. However, the contribution of changes in diagnostic practices to increased prevalence rates has not been thoroughly examined. Debates over the role of diagnostic substitution also continue. California has been an important test case in these controversies. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which the increased prevalence of autism in California has been driven by changes in diagnostic practices, diagnostic substitution and diagnostic accretion. Methods Retrospective case record examination of 7003 patients born before 1987 with autism who were enrolled with the California Department of Developmental Services between 1992 and 2005 was carried out. Of principal interest were 631 patients with a sole diagnosis of mental retardation ({MR}) who subsequently acquired a diagnosis of autism. The outcome of interest was the probability of acquiring a diagnosis of autism as a result of changes in diagnostic practices was calculated. The probability of diagnostic change is then used to model the proportion of the autism caseload arising from changing diagnostic practices. Results The odds of a patient acquiring an autism diagnosis were elevated in periods in which the practices for diagnosing autism changed. The odds of change in years in which diagnostic practices changed were 1.68 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.11-2.54], 1.55 (95\% {CI} 1.03-2.34), 1.58 (95\% {CI} 1.05-2.39), 1.82 (95\% {CI} 1.23-2.7) and 1.61 (95\% {CI} 1.09-2.39). Using the probability of change between 1992 and 2005 to generalize to the population with autism, it is estimated that 26.4\% (95\% {CI} 16.25-36.48) of the increased autism caseload in California is uniquely associated with diagnostic change through a single pathway--individuals previously diagnosed with {MR}. Conclusion Changes in practices for diagnosing autism have had a substantial effect on autism caseloads, accounting for one-quarter of the observed increase in prevalence in California between 1992 and 2005.},

The 5-{HTTLPR} short allele appeared to be additively associated with increasing gray matter volumes, an observation affirmed by tests of linear genotype effects (cortical gray matter: F(1,24) = 14.11, P = .001; frontal lobe gray matter: F(1,24) = 13.20, P = .001). Genotype did not influence cerebellar volumes. Confirmation was pursued by means of the {UW} sample of 15 children. While effects were not significant in the {UW} sample alone, the patterns of adjusted means resembled those found in the {UNC} sample. Positive Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test results supported the concordance of relationships across the 2 sites, and analyses of covariance of the combined sample that included a site covariate showed significant linear genotype effects on structure volumes (cortical gray matter: F(1,38) = 5.73, P = .02; frontal lobe gray matter: F(1,38) = 11.73, P = .002). Effect sizes of 5-{HTTLPR} genotype on total cortical and frontal lobe gray matter volumes were 10\% and 16\%, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: The {SLC}6A4 promoter polymorphism 5-{HTTLPR} influences cerebral cortical gray matter volumes in young male children with autism.},

In addition, the authors found modest levels of similarity (r ≈ .25) between dyad members' self-reports on each of 2 dimensions, Honesty-Humility and Openness to Experience. For these same 2 factors, dyad members' self-reports were correlated with their observer reports of the other dyad member (r ≈ .40), thus indicating moderately high assumed similarity. In Study 2, Honesty-Humility and Openness to Experience were the 2 personality factors most strongly associated with the 2 major dimensions of personal values, which also showed substantial assumed similarity. In Study 3, assumed similarity was considerably stronger for close friends than for nonfriend acquaintances. Results suggest that assumed similarity for Honesty-Humility and Openness to Experience reflects a tendency to overestimate one's similarity to persons with whom one has a close relationship, but only on those personality characteristics whose relevance to values gives them central importance to one's identity.},

	abstract = {Delay discounting ({DD}), a decline in subjective value of a reward with increasing temporal delay in receipt of that reward, is an established behavioral indicator of impulsivity. Preference for smaller-immediate over larger-delayed rewards has been implicated in the basic neurobehavioral mechanisms of risk for addictive disorders and related externalizing psychopathology. Establishing long-term stability of {DD} in adolescence is a necessary step towards its validation as an intermediate phenotype, or marker of risk, in neurobiological and genetic studies. Previous studies have demonstrated moderate to high test–retest reliability of {DD}, however, these studies utilized adult samples and examined relatively short retest intervals. Due to continuing development of brain and behavior, stability of temporal discounting behavior in adolescence may differ from that in adulthood. Here, two cohorts of adolescents aged 16 (n = 126) and 18 (n = 111) were administered a computerized test of {DD} and re-tested two years later. {DD} rate showed a modest but significant decrease with age, suggesting a reduction in overall impulsivity from middle to late adolescence. Significant test–retest correlations were observed in both cohorts (.67 and .76, respectively, p \&lt; .001) indicating longitudinal stability of individual differences in decision-making behavior during middle and late adolescence.

The rest of the body seems to cope surprisingly well, indicating little sign of stress or malfunction. Central nervous system ({CNS}) effects also include some impairment to homeostatic control, particularly thermoregulation, which in humans seem to be minor, but for small mammals the outcome may be more serious. In humans, only a specific part of the lost sleep is made up, suggesting that a certain portion of a night's sleep ("obligatory" sleep) is essential to the brain, and that the remainder ("facultative" sleep) is more dispensable. Contrasting with the nominal {TSD} effects on the body (excluding the {CNS}), there are claims that sleep is necessary for general tissue growth and repair. The underlying evidence is examined, but is shown to have alternative interpretations. Anabolism may not rely so much on sleep, but on food intake and rest.},

	abstract = {Treatments in randomized studies are often targeted to key mediating variables. Researchers want to know if the treatment is effective and how the mediators affect the outcome. The data are often analyzed using structural equation models ({SEMs}), and model coefficients are interpreted as effects. However, only assignment to treatment groups is randomized, so mediators are self-selected treatments. Thus, the so-called direct effects of mediators on later outcomes do not usually warrant a causal interpretation. Holland (1988) studied the case of a single continuous mediator, criticizing the use of {SEMs}. He uses treatment assignment as an instrument for the effect of the mediator on the outcome. However, the assumptions he made to justify this approach are overly strong and substantively implausible. This article (a) makes explicit the assumptions needed to justify equating the parameters of {SEMs} with the effects of mediators, (b) provides weaker and more plausible conditions under which the instrumental variable estimand may be interpreted as an effect, and (c) extends the analysis to include the case of noncompliance.},

The authors describe 3 of these threats and suggest ways to improve the exposition and design of mediation tests. Their conclusion is that inference about mediators is far more difficult than previous research suggests and is best tackled by an experimental research program that is specifically designed to address the challenges of mediation analysis.},

	abstract = {Studies of visual discrimination reversal learning have revealed striking neurochemical dissociations at the level of the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) with serotoninergic, but not dopaminergic, integrity being important for successful reversal learning. These findings have considerable implications for disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia, in which reversal learning is impaired, and which are primarily treated with drugs targeting the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems. Dysfunction in such disorders however, is not limited to the {OFC} and extends subcortically to other structures implicated in reversal learning, such as the medial caudate nucleus. Therefore, because the roles of the serotonin and dopamine within the caudate nucleus are poorly understood, this study compared the effects of selective serotoninergic or selective dopaminergic depletions of the marmoset medial caudate nucleus on serial discrimination reversal learning.
All monkeys were able to learn novel stimulus–reward associations but, unlike control monkeys and monkeys with selective serotoninergic medial caudate depletions, dopamine-depleted monkeys were markedly impaired in their ability to reverse this association. This impairment was not perseverative in nature. These findings are the opposite of those seen in the {OFC} and provide evidence for a neurochemical double dissociation between the {OFC} and medial caudate in the regulation of reversal learning. Although the specific contributions of these monoamines within the {OFC}–striatal circuit remain to be elucidated, these findings have profound implications for the development of drugs designed to remediate some of the cognitive processes underlying impaired reversal learning.},

Based on the idea that both social and unconstrained cognition might be characterized by introspective processes, which are also thought to be highly relevant for emotional experiences, a third meta-analysis was performed investigating studies on emotional processing. By using conjunction analyses across all three sets of studies, we can demonstrate significant overlap of task-related signal change in dorso-medial prefrontal and medial parietal cortex, brain regions that have, indeed, recently been linked to introspective abilities. Our findings, therefore, provide evidence for the existence of a core neural network, which shows task-related signal change during socio-emotional tasks and during resting states.},

This study evaluated the differential neonatal imitative response of 41 macaques in relation to the development of sensory, motor, and cognitive skills throughout the 1st month of life. The results show that infants who imitate facial gestures display more developed skills in goal-directed movements (reaching–grasping and fine hand motor control) than nonimitators. These differences might reflect, at least in part, the differential maturation of motor chains in the parietal and motor cortices, which partly overlap with those of the mirror neuron system. Thus, neonatal imitation appears to be a predictor of future neurobehavioral development.},

Religious racism partly reflects intergroup dynamics. That is, a strong religious in-group identity was associated with derogation of racial out-groups. Other races might be treated as out-groups because religion is practiced largely within race, because training in a religious in-group identity promotes general ethnocentrism, and because different others appear to be in competition for resources. In addition, religious racism is tied to basic life values of social conformity and respect for tradition. In support, individuals who were religious for reasons of conformity and tradition expressed racism that declined in recent years with the decreased societal acceptance of overt racial discrimination. The authors failed to find that racial tolerance arises from humanitarian values, consistent with the idea that religious humanitarianism is largely expressed to in-group members. Only religious agnostics were racially tolerant.},

The results revealed that the model fitted the data adequately, but only in the case of boys. As hypothesized, low levels of empathic responsiveness were associated to students' involvement in bullying others. In contrast, empathy was positively associated with actively helping victimized schoolmates. However, the estimates algorithm did not reach convergence with girls' data. The current findings confirm and extend the literature on the relation between empathy, prosociality and aggressive behavior. Educational implications are also discussed.},

Research also indicates that, in humans, these parts of the social brain undergo structural development, including synaptic reorganization, during adolescence. Bringing together two relatively new and rapidly expanding areas of neuroscience — social neuroscience and the study of brain development during adolescence — will increase our understanding of how the social brain develops during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Poets and philosophers have long acknowledged moral sentiments as key motivators of human social behavior. Prosocial sentiments, which include guilt, pity and embarrassment, enable us to care about others and to be concerned about our mistakes. Functional imaging studies have implicated frontopolar, ventromedial frontal and basal forebrain regions in the experience of prosocial sentiments. Patients with lesions of the frontopolar and ventromedial frontal areas were observed to behave inappropriately and less prosocially, which could be attributed to a generalized emotional blunting. Direct experimental evidence for brain regions distinctively associated with moral sentiment impairments is lacking, however. We investigated this issue in patients with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, a disorder in which early and selective impairments of social conduct are consistently observed. Using a novel moral sentiment task, we show that the degree of impairment of prosocial sentiments is associated with the degree of damage to frontopolar cortex and septal area, as assessed with 18-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose-Positron Emission Tomography, an established measure of neurodegenerative damage. This effect was dissociable from impairment of other-critical feelings (anger and disgust), which was in turn associated with dorsomedial prefrontal and amygdala dysfunction. Our findings suggest a critical role of the frontopolar cortex and septal region in enabling prosocial sentiments, a fundamental component of moral conscience.},

	abstract = {Debate on the social role of the Internet has centred on whether its use will tend to isolate or connect individuals, undermining or reinforcing social ties. This study moves away from this focus on more or less connectivity to explore the degree to which people use the Internet to make new friends and, thereby, reconfigure their social networks. The analysis identifies those who create new ties through the Internet and investigates under what conditions these online ties migrate to face to face settings. The analysis is based on data from the 2005 Oxford Internet Survey ({OxIS}), a national probability sample survey of individuals aged 14 and over in Britain. The findings indicate that about 20 per cent of Internet users have met new friends online, and about half of these individuals go on to meet one or more of these virtual friends in person. Sociodemographic characteristics, such as being single, shape patterns of Internet use, and are related to the greater propensity of some individuals to make online social relationships. However, experience with the Internet and the ways people choose to use the Internet, such as for chatting or communicating more generally, are most directly associated with who makes new connections over the Internet and who does not. These findings suggest that the Internet plays an important role in reconfiguring the social networks of many users. Also, multivariate analyses indicate that the dynamics of online friendships are driven more by the idiosyncratic digital choices made by users of the Internet than by any mechanistic social or technological determinism.},

Rejection from social groups is especially detrimental, rendering the ability to detect threats to social relationships and respond in adaptive ways critical. Indeed, previous research has shown that experiencing social rejection alters the processing of subsequent social cues in a variety of socially affiliative and avoidant ways. Because social perception and cognition occurs spontaneously and automatically, detecting threats to social relationships may occur without conscious awareness or control. Here, we investigated the automaticity of social threat detection by examining how implicit primes affect neural responses to social stimuli. However, despite using a well-established implicit priming paradigm and large sample size, we failed to find any evidence that implicit primes induced changes at the neural level. That implicit primes influence behavior has been demonstrated repeatedly and across a variety of domains, and our goal is not to question these effects. Rather, we offer the present study as cautionary evidence that such a paradigm may not be amenable to scanning in an {fMRI} environment.},

	shorttitle = {The Neural Correlates of Empathy},
	abstract = {Empathy is a critical aspect of human emotion that influences the behavior of individuals as well as the functioning of society. Although empathy is fundamentally a subjective experience, no studies have yet examined the neural correlates of the self-reported experience of empathy. Furthermore, although behavioral research has linked empathy to prosocial behavior, no work has yet connected empathy-related neural activity to everyday, real-world helping behavior. Lastly, the widespread assumption that empathy is an automatic experience remains largely untested. It is also unknown whether differences in trait empathy reflect either variability in the automaticity of empathic responses or the capacity to feel empathy. In this study, 32 participants completed a diary study of helping behavior followed by an {fMRI} session, assessing empathic responses to sad images under three conditions: watching naturally, under cognitive load, and while empathizing. Across conditions, higher levels of self-reported experienced empathy were associated with greater activity in medial {PFC} ({MPFC}). Activity in {MPFC} was also correlated with daily helping behavior. Self-report of empathic experience and activity in empathy-related areas, notably {MPFC}, were higher in the empathize condition than in the load condition, suggesting that empathy is not a fully automatic experience. Additionally, high trait empathy participants displayed greater experienced empathy and stronger {MPFC} responses than low trait empathy individuals under cognitive load, suggesting that empathy is more automatic for individuals high in trait empathy. These results underline the critical role that {MPFC} plays in the instantiation of empathic experience and consequent behavior.},

	abstract = {Many functional neuroimaging studies of biological motion have used as stimuli point-light displays of walking figures and compared the resulting activations with those evoked by the same display elements moving in a random or noncoherent manner. Although these studies have established that biological motion activates the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}), the use of random motion controls has left open the possibility that coordinated and meaningful nonbiological motion might activate these same brain regions and thus call into question their specificity for processing biological motion. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and an anatomical region-of-interest approach to test a hierarchy of three questions regarding activity within the {STS}. First, by comparing responses in the {STS} with animations of human and robot walking figures, we determined (1) that the {STS} is sensitive to biological motion itself, not merely to the superficial characteristics of the stimulus. Then we determined that the {STS} responds more strongly to biological motion (as conveyed by the walking robot) than to (2) a nonmeaningful but complex nonbiological motion (a disjointed mechanical figure) and (3) a complex and meaningful nonbiological motion (the movements of a grandfather clock). In subsequent whole-brain voxel-based analyses, we confirmed robust {STS} activity that was strongly right lateralized. In addition, we observed significant deactivations in the {STS} that differentiated biological and nonbiological motion. These voxel-based analyses also revealed regions of motion-related positive activity in other brain regions, including {MT} or V5, fusiform gyri, right premotor cortex, and the intraparietal sulci.},

Bayesian multilevel model for the analysis of brain {fMRI} data.
A {fMRI} data set consists of time series of volume data in 4D
space. Typically, volumes are collected as slices of 64 x 64
voxels. Analysis of {fMRI} data often relies on fitting linear
regression models at each voxel of the brain. The volume of the
data to be processed, and the type of statistical analysis to
perform in {fMRI} analysis, call for high-performance computing
strategies. In this package, the {CUDA} programming model uses a
separate thread for fitting a linear regression model at each
voxel in parallel. The global statistical model implements a
Gibbs Sampler for hierarchical linear models with a normal
prior. This model has been proposed by Rossi, Allenby and
{McCulloch} in ‘Bayesian Statistics and Marketing’, Chapter 3,
and is referred to as ‘{rhierLinearModel}’ in the R-package
bayesm. A notebook equipped with a {NVIDIA} ‘{GeForce} 8400M {GS}’
card having Compute Capability 1.1 has been used in the tests.
The data sets used in the package's examples are available in
the separate package {cudaBayesregData}.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, synchronized resting-state fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent ({BOLD}) signals between remote brain areas [so-called {BOLD} resting-state functional connectivity (rs-{FC})] have gained enormous relevance in systems and clinical neuroscience. However, the neural underpinnings of rs-{FC} are still incompletely understood. Using simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging we here directly investigated the relationship between rs-{FC} and local neuronal activity in humans. Computational models suggest a mechanistic link between the dynamics of local neuronal activity and the functional coupling among distributed brain regions. Therefore, we hypothesized that the local activity ({LA}) of a region at rest determines its rs-{FC}. To test this hypothesis, we simultaneously measured both {LA} (glucose metabolism) and rs-{FC} (via synchronized {BOLD} fluctuations) during conditions of eyes closed or eyes open. During eyes open, {LA} increased in the visual system, and the salience network (i.e., cingulate and insular cortices) and the pattern of elevated {LA} coincided almost exactly with the spatial pattern of increased rs-{FC}. Specifically, the voxelwise regional profile of {LA} in these areas strongly correlated with the regional pattern of rs-{FC} among the same regions (e.g., {LA} in primary visual cortex accounts for ∼50\%, and {LA} in anterior cingulate accounts for ∼20\% of rs-{FC} with the visual system). These data provide the first direct evidence in humans that local neuronal activity determines {BOLD} {FC} at rest. Beyond its relevance for the neuronal basis of coherent {BOLD} signal fluctuations, our procedure may translate into clinical research particularly to investigate potentially aberrant links between local dynamics and remote functional coupling in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Although investigations into the interactions between these forces have begun to shed light on the neural correlates of affective processing during the transition to adolescence, relatively little is known about the relationship between pubertal development and emotion perception at the neural level. In the current longitudinal study, 45 neurotypical participants were shown affective facial displays while undergoing {fMRI}, at ages 10 and 13. Neural responses to emotional expressions at both time points were then correlated with a self-report measure of pubertal development, revealing positive associations with activity in amygdala, thalamus and visual cortical areas at age 10 that increased in magnitude and extent by age 13. At the latter time point, pubertal development was additionally correlated with enhanced responses to faces in temporal pole, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) and dorsomedial {PFC}. Longitudinal comparisons revealed that the relationships between pubertal development and activity in the amygdala, hippocampus and temporal pole were significantly stronger during early adolescence than late childhood. These results suggest that pubertal development per se is linked to neural processing of socioemotional stimuli, particularly with respect to the integration of complex perceptual input and higher order cortical processing of affective content.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: This study examines the temporal sequencing of sexting and sexual intercourse and the role of active sexting (sending a nude picture) in mediating the relationship between passive sexting (asking or being asked for a nude picture) and sexual behaviors.
{METHODS}: Data are from Wave 2 (spring 2011) and Wave 3 (spring 2012) of an ongoing 6-year longitudinal study of high school students in southeast Texas. Participants included 964 ethnically diverse adolescents with a mean age of 16.09 years (56\% female; 31\% African American, 29\% Caucasian, 28\% Hispanic, 12\% other). Retention rate for 1-year follow-up was 93\%. Participants self-reported history of sexual activity (intercourse, risky sex) and sexting (sent, asked, been asked). Using path analysis, we examined whether teen sexting at baseline predicted sexual behavior at 1-year follow-up and whether active sexting mediated the relationship between passive sexting and sexual behavior.
{RESULTS}: The odds of being sexually active at Wave 3 were 1.32 times larger for youth who sent a sext at Wave 2, relative to counterparts. However, sexting was not temporally associated with risky sexual behaviors. Consistent with our hypothesis, active sexting at Wave 2 mediated the relationship between asking or being asked for a sext and having sex over the next year.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study extends cross-sectional literature and supports the notion that sexting fits within the context of adolescent sexual development and may be a viable indicator of adolescent sexual activity.},

The different realizations of the system are evaluated in three experimental setups to verify effects of affective profiles, as well as of fine-grained communication scenarios on users' expressions of affective states, experienced emotional changes, and interaction patterns. Results demonstrate that the system applied in virtual reality settings matches a Wizard-of-Oz in terms of chatting enjoyment, dialog coherence, and realism. Variants of the system's affective profile significantly influence the rating of chatting enjoyment and an emotional connection. Self-reported emotional changes experienced by participants during an interaction with the system are in line with the type of applied profile. Analysis of interaction patterns, i.e., usage of particular dialog act classes, word categories, and textual expressions of affective states for different scenarios, demonstrates that a communication scenario for social sharing of emotions was successfully established. The experimental evidence provides valuable input for applications of affective dialog systems and strengthens them as valid tools for studying affect and social aspects in online communication.},

	abstract = {Previous neuroimaging studies on empathy have not clearly identified neural systems that support the three components of empathy: affective congruence, perspective-taking, and prosocial motivation. These limitations stem from a focus on a single emotion per study, minimal variation in amount of social context provided, and lack of prosocial motivation assessment. In the current investigation, 32 participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session assessing empathic responses to individuals experiencing painful, anxious, and happy events that varied in valence and amount of social context provided. They also completed a 14-day experience sampling survey that assessed real-world helping behaviors. The results demonstrate that empathy for positive and negative emotions selectively activates regions associated with positive and negative affect, respectively. In addition, the mirror system was more active during empathy for context-independent events (pain), whereas the mentalizing system was more active during empathy for context-dependent events (anxiety, happiness). Finally, the septal area, previously linked to prosocial motivation, was the only region that was commonly activated across empathy for pain, anxiety, and happiness. Septal activity during each of these empathic experiences was predictive of daily helping. These findings suggest that empathy has multiple input pathways, produces affect-congruent activations, and results in septally mediated prosocial motivation.},

Antidepressants may affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, the alteration of which could be partially responsible for treatment efficacy. The association between antidepressants and cortisol was investigated in 1526 subjects of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety who were grouped into 'serotonin reuptake inhibitor ({SSRI}) users' (n=309), 'tricyclic antidepressant ({TCA}) users' (n=49), 'other antidepressant users' (n=100), and 'non-users' (n=1068). All subjects had a current or past diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression. Subjects provided 7 saliva samples from which 3 cortisol indicators were calculated: cortisol awakening response ({CAR}), evening cortisol, and cortisol suppression after ingestion of 0.5mg dexamethasone. As compared to non-users, {TCA} users had a flattened {CAR} (effect size: Cohen's d=0.34); {SSRI} users had higher evening cortisol levels (d=0.04); and {SSRI} users showed decreased cortisol suppression after dexamethasone ingestion (d=0.03). These findings suggest that antidepressant subtypes are associated with distinct alterations of the {HPA} axis. {TCA} users, who showed a flattened {CAR}, displayed the strongest alterations of salivary cortisol.},

A relatively neutral face seems sad when presented alongside a happier face, happy alongside a sadder face. A relatively unhappy face seems sad when presented alongside an angrier face, angry alongside a sadder face. The specific emotion seen in a face can be predicted by combining the idea that human judgment is relative with a model of the scale implicit in the judgment of emotion. In that model, categories and dimensions descriptive of feelings are interrelated in a systematic fashion: Categorical descriptors such as happy, sad, calm, and angry are at specific locations around the periphery of an emotion judgment space defined by degree of pleasure and degree of arousal. Specific hypotheses were tested here in six experiments. Supportive results were found with successive and with simultaneous presentation of anchor and target, with various target expressions including expressions of neutral, surprised, and angry feelings, with both posed and spontaneous target expressions, with target expressions posed by the same actor seen in the anchor and by a different actor, with different groups of observers, and with different emotion category labels.},

Bilateral anterior insula ({AI}), rostral anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), brainstem, and cerebellum were activated when subjects received pain and also by a signal that a loved one experienced pain. {AIand} {ACC} activation correlated with individual empathy scores. Activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, the sensorimotor cortex ({SI}/{MI}), and the caudal {ACC} was specific to receiving pain. Thus, a neural response in {AIand} rostral {ACC}, activated in common for “self” and “other” conditions, suggests that the neural substrate for empathic experience does not involve the entire “pain matrix.” We conclude that only that part of the pain network associated with its affective qualities, but not its sensory qualities, mediates empathy.},

In five experiments, participants (n = 701) were shown two silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words, stories, movies, or facial expressions. They were asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while viewing each stimulus. Different emotions were consistently associated with statistically separable bodily sensation maps across experiments. These maps were concordant across West European and East Asian samples. Statistical classifiers distinguished emotion-specific activation maps accurately, confirming independence of topographies across emotions. We propose that emotions are represented in the somatosensory system as culturally universal categorical somatotopic maps. Perception of these emotion-triggered bodily changes may play a key role in generating consciously felt emotions.},

	abstract = {Activation in frontopolar cortex ({FPC}; {BA} 10) has been associated both with attending to mental states and with integrating multiple mental relations. However, few previous studies have manipulated both of these cognitive processes, precluding a clear functional distinction among regions within {FPC}. To address this issue, we developed an {fMRI} task that combined mentalizing and relational integration processes. Participants saw blocks of single words and performed one of three judgments: how pleasant or unpleasant they found each word (Self condition), how a specific friend would evaluate the pleasantness of the word (Other condition), or the difference between their own pleasantness judgment and that of their friend (Relational condition). We found that medial {FPC} was modulated by Other relative to Self judgments, consistent with a role in mentalizing. Lateral {FPC} was significantly activated during Relational compared to Self judgements, suggesting that this region is particularly involved in relational integration. The results point to a strong functional dissociation between medial and lateral {FPC}. In addition, the data demonstrate a role for lateral {FPC} in the social domain, provided that the task requires the integration of one’s preferences with those of others.},

In two studies we examined whether the sociability and morality components of warmth play distinct roles in such a process. Study 1 (N = 60) investigated which traits were mostly selected when forming impressions about others. The results showed that, regardless of the task goal, traits related to morality and sociability were differently processed. Furthermore, participants were more interested in obtaining information about morality than about sociability when asked to form a global impression about others. Study 2 (N = 98) explored the adoption of asymmetric/symmetric strategies when asking questions to make inferences on others. As predicted, participants adopted an asymmetrically disconfirming strategy on morality traits, while they looked for more symmetrical evidence on sociability or competence traits. Overall, our findings indicated a distinct and a dominant role of the moral component of warmth in the information-gathering process. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recent theories from complexity science argue that complex dynamics are ubiquitous in social and economic systems. These claims emerge from the analysis of individually simple agents whose collective behavior is surprisingly complicated. However, economists have argued that iterated reasoning--what you think I think you think--will suppress complex dynamics by stabilizing or accelerating convergence to Nash equilibrium. We report stable and efficient periodic behavior in human groups playing the Mod Game, a multi-player game similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game rewards subjects for thinking exactly one step ahead of others in their group. Groups that play this game exhibit cycles that are inconsistent with any fixed-point solution concept. These cycles are driven by a "hopping" behavior that is consistent with other accounts of iterated reasoning: agents are constrained to about two steps of iterated reasoning and learn an additional one-half step with each session. If higher-order reasoning can be complicit in complex emergent dynamics, then cyclic and chaotic patterns may be endogenous features of real-world social and economic systems.},

Sleep and mood questionnaires were administered at Time-1 and Time-2. Wrist actigraphy was collected for one week at both times. After delivery, both objective and subjective nighttime sleep significantly worsened with decreased total sleep time and sleep efficiency, while daytime napping behavior significantly increased. On average, mood improved across all scales after delivery, although 45.95\% of the sample experienced deterioration of mood. Regression analyses showed little relationship between Time-1 and Time-2 objective nighttime sleep, and postpartum mood. Variables that related to both Time-1 and Time-2 subjective perception of sleep, including subjective nighttime sleep, sleep-related daytime dysfunction, and daytime napping behavior, were significant predictors of postpartum mood. {CONCLUSIONS}: The perception of poor sleep, and the conscious awareness of its impact during wake-time, might share a stronger relationship with the occurrence of immediate postpartum mood disturbances than actual sleep quality and quantity.},

We offer three explanations for this difference. First, evaluative “attacks” on individuals are more aversive than similar attacks on collectives. Second, to encourage or smooth interaction, people sometimes “assume the best” about individuals until proven wrong. Social interaction occurs between specific individuals, so such optimism does not extend to people in general. Third, in making judgments of individuals versus collectives, people naturally focus on different types of information. For an individual, people spontaneously consider influences that operate inside an individual (e.g., one's will, one's moral conscience). But for collectives, people instead contemplate influences that operate at a social level (e.g., social influence, social norms). We explore how these three proposals help predict when judgments of individuals and collectives do or do not differ.},

In Study 1, after 4- and 5-year-old children watched videos of transgressors either displaying guilt (without explicitly apologizing) or not displaying guilt, 5-year-olds appropriately inferred that the victim would be madder at the unremorseful transgressor and would prefer the remorseful transgressor. They also said that they would prefer to interact with the remorseful transgressor, judged the unremorseful transgressor to be meaner, and, in a distribution of resources task, gave more resources to the remorseful transgressor. The 4-year-olds did not draw any of these inferences and distributed the resources equally. However, Study 2 showed that 4-year-olds were able to draw appropriate inferences about transgressors who explicitly apologized versus those who did not apologize. Thus, 4-year-olds seem to know the appeasement functions that explicit apologies serve but only when children have reached the age of 5 years do they seem to grasp the emotions that apologies stand for, namely, guilt and remorse, and the appeasement functions that displaying these emotions serve.},

	abstract = {Background Our ability to measure the cognitive components of complex decision-making across species has greatly facilitated our understanding of its neurobiological mechanisms. One task in particular, reversal learning, has proven valuable in assessing the inhibitory processes that are central to executive control. Reversal learning measures the ability to actively suppress reward-related responding and to disengage from ongoing behavior, phenomena that are biologically and descriptively related to impulsivity and compulsivity. Consequently, reversal learning could index vulnerability for disorders characterized by impulsivity such as proclivity for initial substance abuse as well as the compulsive aspects of dependence. Objective Though we describe common variants and similar tasks, we pay particular attention to discrimination reversal learning, its supporting neural circuitry, neuropharmacology and genetic determinants. We also review the utility of this task in measuring impulsivity and compulsivity in addictions. Methods We restrict our review to instrumental, reward-related reversal learning studies as they are most germane to addiction. Conclusion The research reviewed here suggests that discrimination reversal learning may be used as a diagnostic tool for investigating the neural mechanisms that mediate impulsive and compulsive aspects of pathological reward-seeking and -taking behaviors. Two interrelated mechanisms are posited for the neuroadaptations in addiction that often translate to poor reversal learning: frontocorticostriatal circuitry dysregulation and poor dopamine (D2 receptor) modulation of this circuitry. These data suggest new approaches to targeting inhibitory control mechanisms in addictions.},

However, it is unknown whether this effect also operates via habitual use of emotion regulation strategies in risky choice involving deliberative decision making. We investigated the role of habitual use of emotion regulation strategies in risky choice using the “cold” deliberative version of the Columbia Card Task ({CCT}; Figner et al., 2009). Fifty-three participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ({ERQ}; Gross \& John, 2003) and—one month later—the {CCT} and the {PANAS}. Greater habitual cognitive reappraisal use was related to increased risk taking, accompanied by decreased sensitivity to changes in probability and loss amount. Greater habitual expressive suppression use was related to decreased risk taking. The results show that habitual use of reappraisal and suppression strategies predict risk taking when decisions involve predominantly cognitive-deliberative processes.},

Recently, this growth has carried an increasing emphasis on research to establish the evidence base for social work practice and an emphasis on understanding dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions or practice models in usual care settings within service systems that have historic and professional linkages to the social work discipline, such as child welfare and mental health.
• Findings: This article illustrates this growth and emphases on evidence-based practice in the social work research areas, child abuse and neglect, child welfare and child mental health through the two-decade experience of a large-scale and multi-disciplinary research center in San Diego County, California, the Child and Adolescent Services Research Center ({CASRC}). Evidence for understanding and improving care in these two service systems served by social work practice has been developed through center studies of clinical epidemiology, mental health services, effectiveness of evidence-based interventions, and the dissemination and implementation of these interventions in usual care settings.
• Applications: This evolving research agenda was shown to be well linked to the {NIH} Roadmap initiative and highly competitive for {NIH} funding.},

In Study 1, individual differences in the need to belong were found to be positively related to accuracy in identifying vocal tone and facial emotion. Study 2 examined attention to vocal tone and accuracy in a more complex social sensitivity task (an empathic accuracy task). Replicating the results of Study 1, need to belong scores predicted both attention to vocal tone and empathic accuracy. Study 3 provided evidence that the enhanced performance shown by those high in the need to belong is specific to social perception skills rather than to cognitive problem solving more generally.},

We also found that the stimulus value signals used to make empathic choices were computed using a mixture of self-simulation and other-simulation processes, and that activity in {IPL} encoded a variable measuring the distance between the other's and self preferences, which provides a hint for how the mixture of self- and other-simulation might be implemented.},

Utilizing a behavioral task assessing risk-taking, 183 older adolescents (18–20 year olds) came to the laboratory alone once and then were randomized to one of three conditions as follows: alone, peers present, and peers encouraging. An interaction was found such that at baseline, there were no significant differences between the three conditions, but at the experimental session, there was a significant increase in risk task scores particularly for the encouraging condition. These findings challenge proposed models of the interaction between peer influence and risk taking by providing evidence that adolescents take more risks when being encouraged by peers, but that the presence of peers on its own does not lead to more risks than when completing the task alone.},

Additionally, previous neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have neglected the direct comparison of these developmentally critical mental-state concepts. Event-related brain potentials were recorded as participants (N = 24; mean age = 22 years) reasoned about diverse-desires, diverse-beliefs, and parallel physical situations. A mid-frontal late slow wave ({LSW}) was associated with desire and belief judgments. A right-posterior {LSW} was only associated with belief judgments. These findings demonstrate neural overlap and critical differences in reasoning explicitly about desires and beliefs, and they suggest children recruit additional neural processes for belief judgments beyond a common, more general, mentalizing neural system.},

Multivariate pattern analysis ({MVPA}) is a relatively recent innovation in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) methods. {MVPA} is increasingly widely used, as it is apparently more effective than classical general linear model analysis ({GLMA}) for detecting response patterns or representations that are distributed at a fine spatial scale. However, we demonstrate that widely used approaches to {MVPA} can systematically admit certain confounds that are appropriately eliminated by {GLMA}. Thus confounds rather than distributed representations may explain some cases in which {MVPA} produced positive results but {GLMA} did not. The issue is that it is common practice in {MVPA} to conduct group tests on single-subject summary statistics that discard the sign or direction of underlying effects, whereas {GLMA} group tests are conducted directly on single-subject effects themselves. We describe how this common {MVPA} practice undermines standard experiment design logic that is intended to control at the group level for certain types of confounds, such as time on task and individual differences. Furthermore, we note that a simple application of linear regression can restore experimental control when using {MVPA} in many situations. Finally, we present a case study with novel {fMRI} data in the domain of rule representations, or flexible stimulus–response mappings, which has seen several recent {MVPA} publications. In our new dataset, as with recent reports, standard {MVPA} appears to reveal rule representations in prefrontal cortex regions, whereas {GLMA} produces null results. However, controlling for a variable that is confounded with rule at the individual-subject level but not the group level (reaction time differences across rules) eliminates the {MVPA} results. This raises the question of whether recently reported results truly reflect rule representations, or rather the effects of confounds such as reaction time, difficulty, or other variables of no interest.},

	abstract = {This meta-analysis explores the role of the mirror and mentalizing systems in the understanding of other people's action goals. Based on over 200 {fMRI} studies, this analysis demonstrates that the mirror system – consisting of the anterior intraparietal sulcus and the premotor cortex – is engaged when one perceives articulated motions of body parts irrespective of their sensory (visual or auditory) or verbal format as well as when the perceiver executes them. This confirms the matching role of the mirror system in understanding biological action. Observation of whole-body motions and gaze engage the posterior superior temporal sulcus and most likely reflects an orientation response in line with the action or attention of the observed actor. In contrast, the mentalizing system – consisting of the temporo-parietal junction, the medial prefrontal cortex and the precuneus – is activated when behavior that enables inferences to be made about goals, beliefs or moral issues is presented in abstract terms (e.g., verbal stories or geometric shapes) and there is no perceivable biological motion of body parts. A striking overlap of brain activity at the temporo-parietal junction between social inferences and other, non-social observations (e.g., Posner's cuing task) suggests that this area computes the orientation or direction of the behavior in order to predict its likely end-state (or goal). No conclusions are drawn about the specific functionality of the precuneus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Because the mirror and mentalizing systems are rarely concurrently active, it appears that neither system subserves the other. Rather, they are complementary. There seems, however, to be a transition from the mirror to the mentalizing system even when body-part motions are observed by perceivers who are consciously deliberating about the goals of others and their behavioral executions, such as when perceived body motions are contextually inconsistent, implausible or pretended.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

This is a retrospective study comparing 2007 American Academy of Sleep Medicine ({AASM}) pediatric scoring criteria and Stanford scoring criteria of pediatric polysomnograms to characterize the impact different scoring systems have upon the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing in children.


{METHODS}

The diagnostic and post-treatment nocturnal polysomnograms ({PSGs}) of children (age 2-18 years) consecutively referred to an academic sleep clinic for evaluation of suspected sleep disordered breathing ({SDB}) for 1 year were independently analyzed by a single researcher using {AASM} and Stanford scoring criteria in a blinded fashion.


{RESULTS}

A total of 209 (83 girls) children with suspected {SDB} underwent clinical evaluation and diagnostic {PSG}. Analysis of the diagnostic {PSGs} using the Stanford and {AASM} criteria classified 207 and 39 studies as abnormal, respectively. The {AASM} scoring criteria classified 19\% of subjects as having obstructive sleep apnea ({OSA}) while the Stanford criteria diagnosed 99\% of the subjects with {OSA} who were referred for evaluation of suspected sleep disordered breathing. There was a positive correlation between {SDB}-related clinical symptoms and anatomic risk factors for {SDB}. Scatter-plot analyses showed that the {AASM} apnea hypopnea index ({AHI}) was not only significantly lower compared to the Stanford {AHI} but also skewed in distribution. Ninety-nine children were restudied with {PSG} (9 were initially diagnosed with {SDB} with {AASM} criteria, whereas all 99 were diagnosed with {SDB} with Stanford criteria). All 99 children had been treated and had a post-treatment clinical evaluation and post-treatment {PSG} during the study period. All 99 children evaluated after treatment showed improvement in clinical presentation, Stanford {AHI}, and oxygen saturation during sleep.


{CONCLUSION}

The {AASM} scoring criteria classified 19\% of subjects as having {OSA} while the Stanford criteria diagnosed 99\% of the subjects with {OSA} who were referred for evaluation of suspected sleep disordered breathing. The primary factor differentiating the {AASM} and Stanford criteria was the scoring of hypopneas. The {AASM} definition of hypopnea may be detrimental to the recognition of {SDB} in children.},

However the demonstration that the electrical activity of 5-{HT} perikarya and the release of 5-{HT} are increased during waking and decreased during sleep was in direct contradiction to this hypothesis. More recent experiments suggest that the release of 5-{HT} during waking may initiate a cascade of genomic events in some hypnogenic neurons located in the preoptic area. Thus, when 5-{HT} is released during waking, it leads to an homeostatic regulation of slow-wave sleep.},

We tested the hypothesis that normal hypothalamic sexual dimorphism is disrupted in schizophrenia.
Eighty-eight {DSM}-{III}-R schizophrenia cases (40 simplex and 48 multiplex), 43 first-degree nonpsychotic relatives, and 48 normal comparisons systematically were compared. A 1.5-Tesla General Electric scanner was used to acquire structural {MRI} scans, and contiguous 3.1-mm slices were used to segment anterior and posterior hypothalamus. General linear model for correlated data and generalized estimating equations were used to compare cases, relatives, and controls on right and left hypothalamus, controlled for age, sex, and total cerebral volume. Spearman’s correlations of hypothalamic volumes with anxiety were calculated to begin to examine arousal correlates with structural abnormalities.
Findings demonstrated significantly increased hypothalamic volume in cases and nonpsychotic relatives, particularly in regions of paraventricular and mammillary body nuclei, respectively. This increase was linear from simplex to multiplex cases, was positively correlated with anxiety, and had a greater propensity in women.
Findings suggest important implications for understanding genetic vulnerability of schizophrenia and the high rate of endocrine abnormalities.},

Using open-ended impressions based on photographs, videos, and face-to-face encounters, three studies show agreeableness as the most prevalently judged of the Big Five, although it is also poorly judged in both absolute and relative terms. The authors use interpersonal power to reveal an underlying mechanism. Manipulating the power of perceivers relative to targets substantially shifts impression content, suggesting that habitual interaction and relational concerns may partially explain perceiver's chronic interest in assessing agreeableness despite their limited ability to do so.},

	abstract = {An association between autistic spectrum disorder and imitative impairment might result from dysfunction in mirror neurons ({MNs}) that serve to relate observed actions to motor codings. To explore this hypothesis, we employed a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) protocol previously used to identify the neural substrate of imitation, and human {MN} function, to compare 16 adolescent males of normal intelligence with autistic spectrum disorder ({ASD}) and age, sex and {IQ} matched controls. In the control group, in accord with previous findings, we identified activity attributable to {MNs} in areas of the right parietal lobe. Activity in this area was less extensive in the {ASD} group and was absent during non-imitative action execution. Broca's area was minimally active during imitation in controls. Differential patterns of activity during imitation and action observation in {ASD} and controls were most evident in an area at the right temporo-parietal junction also associated with a ‘theory of mind’ ({ToM}) function. {ASD} participants also failed to show modulation of left amygdala activity during imitation that was evident in the controls. This may have implications for understanding the imitation of emotional stimuli in {ASD}. Overall, we suggest that {ASD} is associated with altered patterns of brain activity during imitation, which could stem from poor integration between areas serving visual, motor, proprioceptive and emotional functions. Such poor integration is likely to adversely affect the development of {ToM} through imitation as well as other aspects of social cognitive function in {ASD}.},

This review focuses primarily on the findings of research investigating the role of the amygdala in modulating the consolidation of long-term memories. Considerable evidence from animal studies investigating the effects of posttraining systemic or intra-amygdala infusions of hormones and drugs, as well as selective lesions of specific amygdala nuclei, indicates that (a) the amygdala mediates the memory-modulating effects of adrenal stress hormones and several classes of neurotransmitters; (b) the effects are selectively mediated by the basolateral complex of the amygdala ({BLA}); (c) the influences involve interactions of several neuromodulatory systems within the {BLA} that converge in influencing noradrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic activation; (d) the {BLA} modulates memory consolidation via efferents to other brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex; and (e) the {BLA} modulates the consolidation of memory of many different kinds of information. The findings of human brain imaging studies are consistent with those of animal studies in suggesting that activation of the amygdala influences the consolidation of long-term memory; the degree of activation of the amygdala by emotional arousal during encoding of emotionally arousing material (either pleasant or unpleasant) correlates highly with subsequent recall. The activation of neuromodulatory systems affecting the {BLA} and its projections to other brain regions involved in processing different kinds of information plays a key role in enabling emotionally significant experiences to be well remembered.},

known to affect mood and aggression, the serotonin transporter (5-{HTTLPR}) and monoamine oxidase A ({MAOA}-{VNTR}) polymorphisms,
in 50 males with {FXS} ages 8–24 years. Mothers and fathers of participants reported the frequency and severity of aggressive/destructive,
self-injurious, and stereotypic behaviors. Polymorphism genotypes were unrelated to age and {IQ}. Results showed a significant
effect of 5-{HTTLPR} genotype on aggressive/destructive and stereotypic behavior; males with {FXS} who were homozygous for the
high-transcribing long (L/L) genotype had the most aggressive and destructive behavior, and individuals homozygous for the
short (S/S) genotype had the least aggression. Those with the L/L genotype also had the highest levels of stereotypic behavior.
There was no effect of {MAOA}-{VNTR} on behavior; however those with the high-activity, 4-repeat genotype were more likely to
be taking {SSRI} or {SNRI} medication. This preliminary study prompts consideration of secondary genes that may modify behavioral
phenotype expression in neurodevelopmental disorders, even those with a single gene etiology such as {FXS}.},

	abstract = {\%Hyperactivity of the hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal ({HPA}) axis has been reliably observed in patients with major depression. One of the primary features of this {HPA} axis hyperactivity is reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone on the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol during the dexamethasone suppression test and, more recently, the dexamethasoneâ€“corticotropin-releasing hormone test. Because the effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by intracellular receptors including, most notably, the glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}), a number of studies have considered the possibility that the number and/or function of {GRs} are reduced in depressed patients. Moreover, whether antidepressants act by reversing these putative {GR} changes has been examined. The extant literature on {GR} receptors in major depression was reviewed along with studies examining the impact of antidepressants on the {GR}. The data support the hypothesis that the function of the {GR} is reduced in major depression in the absence of clear evidence of decreased {GR} expression. The data also indicate that some antidepressants have direct effects on the {GR}, leading to enhanced {GR} function and increased {GR} expression. Hypotheses regarding the mechanism of these receptor changes involve relevant second messenger pathways that regulate {GR} function. The findings indicate that the {GR} is an important molecular target in major depression. Further elucidation of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in {GR} changes in major depression is an exciting frontier that will no doubt lead to new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual classification problems. Given that {DNNs} are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a {DNN} to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art {DNNs} believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99\% confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the {ImageNet} or {MNIST} datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that {DNNs} label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that {DNNs} believe with near certainty are familiar objects. Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current {DNNs}, and raise questions about the generality of {DNN} computer vision.},

We present work on using a crowdsourcing methodology to build a large corpus of postings on Twitter that have been shared by individuals diagnosed with clinical depression. Next, we develop a probabilistic model trained on this corpus to determine if posts could indicate depression. The model leverages signals of social activity, emotion, and language manifested on Twitter. Using the model, we introduce a social media depression index that may serve to characterize levels of depression in populations. Geographical, demographic and seasonal patterns of depression given by the measure confirm psychiatric findings and correlate highly with depression statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}).},

One hundred eighty-four people, age 18 to 94 years, participated in an experience-sampling procedure in which emotions were recorded across a 1-week period. Age was unrelated to frequency of positive emotional experience. A curvilinear relationship best characterized negative emotional experience. Negative emotions declined in frequency until approximately age 60, at which point the decline ceased. Individual factor analyses computed for each participant revealed that age was associated with more differentiated emotional experience. In addition, periods of highly positive emotional experience were more likely to endure among older people and periods of highly negative emotional experience were less stable.

While religious involvement offers clear benefits to many, in this paper we explore whether it may also be detrimental to some. Specifically, we examine in detail the relation between religious involvement and subjective well-being. We first replicate prior findings showing a positive relation between religiosity and subjective well-being. However, our results also suggest that this relation may be more complex than previously thought. While fervent believers benefit from their involvement, those with weaker beliefs are actually less happy than those who do not ascribe to any religion—atheists and agnostics. These results may help explain why—in spite of the well-documented benefits of religion—an increasing number of people are abandoning their faith. As commitment wanes, religious involvement may become detrimental to well-being, and individuals may be better off seeking new affiliations.},

Infants watched events involving an agent and 2 toy penguins; 1 penguin could be disassembled (2-piece penguin) and 1 could not (1-piece penguin).

	abstract = {Complex human diseases do not have a clear inheritance pattern, and it is expected that risk involves multiple genes with modest effects acting independently or interacting. Major challenges for the identification of genetic effects are genetic heterogeneity and difficulty in analyzing high-order interactions. To address these challenges, we present {MDR}-Phenomics, a novel approach based on the multifactor dimensionality reduction ({MDR}) method, to detect genetic effects in pedigree data by integration of phenotypic covariates ({PCs}) that may reflect genetic heterogeneity. The P value of the test is calculated using a permutation test adjusted for multiple tests. To validate {MDR}-Phenomics, we compared it with two {MDR}-based methods: (1) traditional {MDR} pedigree disequilibrium test ({PDT}) without consideration of {PCs} ({MDR}-{PDT}) and (2) stratified phenotype ({SP}) analysis based on {PCs}, with use of {MDR}-{PDT} with a Bonferroni adjustment ({SP}-{MDR}). Using computer simulations, we examined the statistical power and type I error of the different approaches under several genetic models and sampling scenarios. We conclude that {MDR}-Phenomics is more powerful than {MDR}-{PDT} and {SP}-{MDR} when there is genetic heterogeneity, and the statistical power is affected by sample size and the number of {PC} levels. We further compared {MDR}-Phenomics with conditional logistic regression ({CLR}) for testing interactions across single or multiple loci with consideration of {PC}. The results show that {CLR} with {PC} has only slightly smaller power than does {MDR}-Phenomics for single-locus analysis but has considerably smaller power for multiple loci. Finally, by applying {MDR}-Phenomics to autism, a complex disease in which multiple genes are believed to confer risk, we attempted to identify multiple gene effects in two candidate genes of interest--the serotonin transporter gene ({SLC}6A4) and the integrin beta 3 gene ({ITGB}3) on chromosome 17. Analyzing four markers in {SLC}6A4 and four markers in {ITGB}3 in 117 white family triads with autism and using sex of the proband as a {PC}, we found significant interaction between two markers--rs1042173 in {SLC}6A4 and rs3809865 in {ITGB}3.},

Group members respond vicariously to benefits obtained by others, and impairments in this capacity contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and sociopathy. We examined the manner in which neurons in three frontal cortical areas encoded the outcomes of social decisions as monkeys performed a reward-allocation task. Neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) predominantly encoded rewards that were delivered to oneself. Neurons in the anterior cingulate gyrus ({ACCg}) encoded reward allocations to the other monkey, to oneself or to both. Neurons in the anterior cingulate sulcus ({ACCs}) signaled reward allocations to the other monkey or to no one. In this network of received ({OFC}) and foregone ({ACCs}) reward signaling, {ACCg} emerged as an important nexus for the computation of shared experience and social reward. Individual and species-specific variations in social decision-making might result from the relative activation and influence of these areas.},

	abstract = {Aged, cognitively-impaired rats (and humans) show hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) hyperactivity that correlates with hippocampal damage. The resultant increase in plasma glucocorticoid exposure is thought to contribute to impaired hippocampal function and to potentiate hippocampal neuron death. In young, adult rats antidepressant drugs increase corticosteroid receptor expression in brain regions known to regulate the {HPA} axis, leading to increased negative-feedback control and decreased {HPA} activity. In the present study we examined basal levels of plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone ({ACTH}) and corticosterone in aged, cognitively-impaired ({AI}), aged, cognitively-unimpaired ({AU}) and young, adult (Yg) rats. Plasma {ACTH} and corticosterone levels were significantly elevated in the {AI} rats, but only in samples obtained during the diurnal peak. Five weeks of treatment with desipramine (15 mg/kg) significantly reduced evening levels of both {ACTH} and corticosterone in all groups, and eliminated the group differences. We then examined delayed, glucocorticoid negative feedback in these animals. Among vehicle-treated animals, a bolus injection of corticosterone (10 mg/kg), administered 3 hours prior to testing, completely inhibited the plasma {ACTH} response to restraint in {AU} and Yg, but not {AI} animals. In contrast, plasma {ACTH} responses to restraint were completely inhibited in {AI} rats following chronic treatment with desipramine. These findings indicate that the antidepressant, desipramine, decreases {HPA} activity and increases glucocorticoid negative-feedback sensitivity in {AI} rats, suggesting that antidepressant drugs may form a useful therapeutic approach to {HPA} dysfunction in elderly human populations.},

This study tested for association between the 5-{HTTLPR} and {ASD} in a Brazilian sample by case-control and family-based association test ({FBAT}) methods, considering the biallelic and triallelic structures of this polymorphism. In addition, we performed an exploratory analysis of associations between specific clinical outcomes of {ASD} patients and 5-{HTTLPR} as well as several prenatal environmental factors. Genotyping was achieved in 151 {ASD} patients, 179 unrelated controls and 105 complete trios. There was no evidence of association between the 5-{HTTLPR} with {ASD} in both case-control and {FBAT} tests, but the {LaLa} 5-{HTTLPR} genotype was associated with mood instability in patients (P = 0.006). The prenatal exposure to potential neuroteratogenic drugs was associated with epilepsy (P {\textless} 0.001). Our findings suggest that the 5-{HTTLPR} is not associated with {ASD} in the Brazilian population, even considering the triallelic structure. Additionally, this study suggested a role of the 5-{HTTLPR} and environmental factors in the clinical expression of {ASD}.},

The insula has hence been ascribed an integrative role, linking information from diverse functional systems. Nevertheless, various anatomical and functional studies in humans and non-human primates also indicate a functional differentiation of this region. In order to investigate this functional differentiation as well as the mechanisms of the functional integration in the insula, we performed activation-likelihood-estimation ({ALE}) meta-analyses of 1,768 functional neuroimaging experiments. The analysis revealed four functionally distinct regions on the human insula, which map to the social-emotional, the sensorimotor, the olfacto-gustatory, and the cognitive network of the brain. Sensorimotor tasks activated the mid-posterior and social-emotional tasks the anterior-ventral insula. In the central insula activation by olfacto-gustatory stimuli was found, and cognitive tasks elicited activation in the anterior-dorsal region. A conjunction analysis across these domains revealed that aside from basic somatosensory and motor processes all tested functions overlapped on the anterior-dorsal insula. This overlap might constitute a correlate for a functional integration between different functional systems and thus reflect a link between them necessary to integrate different qualities into a coherent experience of the world and setting the context for thoughts and actions.},

	abstract = {Damage to the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) has been linked to impaired reinforcement processing and maladaptive behavior in changing environments across species. Flexible stimulus–outcome learning, canonically captured by reversal learning tasks, has been shown to rely critically on {OFC} in rats, monkeys, and humans. However, the precise role of {OFC} in this learning remains unclear. Furthermore, whether other frontal regions also contribute has not been definitively established, particularly in humans. In the present study, a reversal learning task with probabilistic feedback was administered to 39 patients with focal lesions affecting various sectors of the frontal lobes and to 51 healthy, demographically matched control subjects. Standard groupwise comparisons were supplemented with voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to identify regions within the frontal lobes critical for task performance. Learning in this dynamic stimulus-reinforcement environment was considered both in terms of overall performance and at the trial-by-trial level. In this challenging, probabilistic context, {OFC} damage disrupted both initial and reversal learning. Trial-by-trial performance patterns suggest that {OFC} plays a critical role in interpreting feedback from a particular trial within the broader context of the outcome history across trials rather than in simply suppressing preexisting stimulus–outcome associations. The findings show that {OFC}, and not other prefrontal regions, plays a necessary role in flexible stimulus–reinforcement learning in humans.},

Psychologists have traditionally used self-report measures and performance on laboratory tasks to achieve this end. However, these measures are limited in their ability to predict behavior in certain contexts. We argue that current neuroscientific knowledge has reached a point where it can complement other existing psychological measures in predicting behavior and other important outcomes. This brain-as-predictor approach integrates traditional neuroimaging methods with measures of behavioral outcomes that extend beyond the immediate experimental session. Previously, most neuroimaging experiments focused on understanding basic psychological processes that could be directly observed in the laboratory. However, recent experiments have demonstrated that brain measures can predict outcomes (e.g., purchasing decisions, clinical outcomes) over longer timescales in ways that go beyond what was previously possible with self-report data alone. This approach can be used to reveal the connections between neural activity in laboratory contexts and longer-term, ecologically valid outcomes. We describe this approach and discuss its potential theoretical implications. We also review recent examples of studies that have used this approach, discuss methodological considerations, and provide specific guidelines for using it in future research.},

Such brain-based analyses are critical if our ways of labeling emotions are to be evaluated and revised based on consistency with brain data. Consistent activations were limited to specific cortical sub-regions, including multiple functional areas within medial, orbital, and inferior lateral frontal cortices. Consistent with a wealth of animal literature, multiple subcortical activations were identified, including amygdala, ventral striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray. We used multivariate parcellation and clustering techniques to identify groups of co-activated brain regions across studies. These analyses identified six distributed functional groups, including medial and lateral frontal groups, two posterior cortical groups, and paralimbic and core limbic/brainstem groups. These functional groups provide information on potential organization of brain regions into large-scale networks. Specific follow-up analyses focused on amygdala, periaqueductal gray ({PAG}), and hypothalamic (Hy) activations, and identified frontal cortical areas co-activated with these core limbic structures. While multiple areas of frontal cortex co-activated with amygdala sub-regions, a specific region of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({dmPFC}, Brodmann’s Area 9/32) was the only area co-activated with both {PAG} and Hy. Subsequent mediation analyses were consistent with a pathway from {dmPFC} through {PAG} to Hy. These results suggest that medial frontal areas are more closely associated with core limbic activation than their lateral counterparts, and that {dmPFC} may play a particularly important role in the cognitive generation of emotional states.},

We conduct a simultaneous analysis of a wide range of theoretically important social influences and a more complete range of individuals’ value orientations, focusing both on value ratings and rankings. Results indicate that traditional institutions such as religion and parenthood are associated with more concern for the welfare of others and maintaining the status quo, whereas more individually oriented occupational factors like higher income and self-employment are linked to achievement and change-related values. Yet several factors, such as education and gender, have complex associations when individual values are examined as part of a coherent system rather than in isolation.},

Method: National Comorbidity Survey ({NCS}) data from 591 individuals diagnosed with {PTSD} were analyzed. Revised versions of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and Composite International Diagnostic Interview were administered to a representative sample of males and females. Groups consisted of patients diagnosed with lifetime {PTSD} and with current comorbid panic disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol dependence. Results: Patients diagnosed with {PTSD}/panic disorder reported a significantly greater proportion of nightmare complaints (96\%) and insomnia (100\%) compared with the other comorbid groups. Conclusions: A greater proportion of {PTSD} patients with comorbid panic disorder complain of sleep-related problems than other comorbid groups. This effect appears unique to panic, rather than other general anxiety disorder or depression. Prospective sleep studies are needed to differentiate the role of sleep in {PTSD} and {PD}, as well as to examine the role of psychiatric comorbidity in worsening sleep in {PTSD} patients.},

Two studies of naturalistic interactions examined perceiver effects for personality traits: seeing a typical other as sympathetic or quarrelsome, responsible or careless, and so forth. Several basic questions were addressed. First, are perceiver effects organized as a global evaluative halo, or do perceptions of different traits vary in distinct ways? Second, does assumed similarity (as evidenced by self-perceiver correlations) reflect broad evaluative consistency or trait-specific content? Third, are perceiver effects a manifestation of stable beliefs about the generalized other, or do they form in specific contexts as group-specific stereotypes? Findings indicated that perceiver effects were better described by a differentiated, multidimensional structure with both trait-specific content and a higher order global evaluation factor. Assumed similarity was at least partially attributable to trait-specific content, not just to broad evaluative similarity between self and others. Perceiver effects were correlated with gender and attachment style, but in newly formed groups, they became more stable over time, suggesting that they grew dynamically as group stereotypes. Implications for the interpretation of perceiver effects and for research on personality assessment and psychopathology are discussed.},

	abstract = {Latent state–trait ({LST}) theory is a generalization of classical test theory designed to take account of the fact that psychological measurement does not take place in a situational vacuum. The basic concepts of latent state–trait theory ({LST} theory) are introduced. The core of {LST} theory consists of two decompositions: (a) the decomposition of any observed score into latent state and measurement error, and (b) the decomposition of any latent state into latent trait and latent state residual representing situational and/or interaction effects. Latent states and latent traits are defined as special conditional expectations. A score on a latent state variable is defined as the expectation of an observable variable Yik given a person in a situation whereas a score on a latent trait variable is the expectation of Yik given a person. The theory also comprises the definition of consistency, occasion specificity, reliability, and stability coefficients. An overview of different models of {LST} theory is given. It is shown how different research questions of personality psychology can be and have been analysed within the {LST} framework and why research in personality and individual differences can profit from {LST} theory and methodology.

	abstract = {Statistical thresholding (i.e. P-values) in {fMRI} research has become increasingly conservative over the past decade in an attempt to diminish Type I errors (i.e. false alarms) to a level traditionally allowed in behavioral science research. In this article, we examine the unintended negative consequences of this single-minded devotion to Type I errors: increased Type {II} errors (i.e. missing true effects), a bias toward studying large rather than small effects, a bias toward observing sensory and motor processes rather than complex cognitive and affective processes and deficient meta-analyses. Power analyses indicate that the reductions in acceptable P-values over time are producing dramatic increases in the Type {II} error rate. Moreover, the push for a mapwide false discovery rate ({FDR}) of 0.05 is based on the assumption that this is the {FDR} in most behavioral research; however, this is an inaccurate assessment of the conventions in actual behavioral research. We report simulations demonstrating that combined intensity and cluster size thresholds such as P {\textless} 0.005 with a 10 voxel extent produce a desirable balance between Types I and {II} error rates. This joint threshold produces high but acceptable Type {II} error rates and produces a {FDR} that is comparable to the effective {FDR} in typical behavioral science articles (while a 20 voxel extent threshold produces an actual {FDR} of 0.05 with relatively common imaging parameters). We recommend a greater focus on replication and meta-analysis rather than emphasizing single studies as the unit of analysis for establishing scientific truth. From this perspective, Type I errors are self-erasing because they will not replicate, thus allowing for more lenient thresholding to avoid Type {II} errors.},

Reappraisal of highly negative scenes reduced subjective experience of negative affect. Neural correlates of reappraisal were increased activation of the lateral and medial prefrontal regions and decreased activation of the amygdala and medial orbito-frontal cortex. These findings support the hypothesis that prefrontal cortex is involved in constructing reappraisal strategies that can modulate activity in multiple emotion-processing systems.},

The purpose of this investigation was to analyze the linkage of the human leukocyte antigen ({HLA}) and the human serotonin transporter coding (5-{HTTLPR}) genes with {ASD} in a group of 37 families of Sardinian ethnicity in insular Italy. In 50\% of these families, {ASD} is linked to {HLA}, and in the other 50\% it is linked to 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphic genes; in other words, linkage to one or the other was evident in all cases. Despite a very homogenous genetic pattern being generally reported for Sardinians, the linkage observed with {HLA} and 5-{HTTLPR} genetic regions indicated a statistically defined heterogeneity (p = 0.002). No allelic {HLA} or 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphisms were specifically associated with {ASD}, suggesting these loci as markers of other genes mapped in their close proximity that may be more directly involved and thus may merit further analytical studies.},

With a surge of studies in affective neuroscience in recent decades, scientists are poised to answer this question. In this target article, we present a meta-analytic summary of the neuroimaging literature on human emotion. We compare the locationist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories consistently and specifically correspond to distinct brain regions) with the psychological constructionist approach (i.e., the hypothesis that discrete emotion categories are constructed of more general brain networks not specific to those categories) to better understand the brain basis of emotion. We review both locationist and psychological constructionist hypotheses of brain–emotion correspondence and report meta-analytic findings bearing on these hypotheses. Overall, we found little evidence that discrete emotion categories can be consistently and specifically localized to distinct brain regions. Instead, we found evidence that is consistent with a psychological constructionist approach to the mind: A set of interacting brain regions commonly involved in basic psychological operations of both an emotional and non-emotional nature are active during emotion experience and perception across a range of discrete emotion categories.},

We employed {OSA} to test for interlocus correlations between loci with {LOD} scores [greater than or equal to]1.5, and empirically determined significance of linkage in optimal {OSA} subsets using permutation testing. Exploring phenotypic correlates as the basis for linkage increases involved comparison of mean scores for quantitative trait-based subsets of autism between optimal subsets and the remaining families.{RESULTS}:A genome-wide screen for autism loci identified the best evidence for linkage to 17q11.2 and 19p13, with maximum multipoint heterogeneity {LOD} scores of 2.9 and 2.6, respectively. Suggestive linkage ({LOD} scores [greater than or equal to]1.5) at other loci included 3p, 6q, 7q, 12p, and 16p. {OSA} revealed positive correlations of linkage between the 19p locus and 17q, between 19p and 6q, and between 7q and 5p. While potential phenotypic correlates for these findings were not identified for the chromosome 7/5 combination, differences indicating more rapid achievement of "developmental milestones" was apparent in the chromosome 19 {OSA}-defined subsets for 17q and 6q. {OSA} was used to test the hypothesis that 19p linkage involved more rapid achievement of these milestones and it revealed significantly increased {LOD}* scores at 19p13.{CONCLUSIONS}:Our results further support 19p13 as harboring an autism susceptibility locus, confirm other linkage findings at 17q11.2, and demonstrate the need to analyze more discreet trait-based subsets of complex phenotypes to improve ability to detect genetic effects.},

	abstract = {A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random ({MCAR}); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing {MCAR}, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for {MCAR} that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

Our approach uses a genetic algorithm ({GA}), a class of flexible search algorithms that optimize designs with respect to single or multiple measures of fitness. Two strengths of the {GA} framework are that (1) it operates with any sort of model, allowing for very specific parameterization of experimental conditions, including nonstandard trial types and experimentally observed scanner autocorrelation, and (2) it is flexible with respect to fitness criteria, allowing optimization over known or novel fitness measures. We describe how genetic algorithms may be applied to experimental design for {fMRI}, and we use the framework to explore the space of possible {fMRI} design parameters, with the goal of providing information about optimal design choices for several types of designs. In our simulations, we considered three fitness measures: contrast estimation efficiency, hemodynamic response estimation efficiency, and design counterbalancing. Although there are inherent trade-offs between these three fitness measures, {GA} optimization can produce designs that outperform random designs on all three criteria simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Understanding others’ emotions requires both the identification of overt behaviors (“smiling”) and the attribution of behaviors to a cause (“friendly disposition”). Previous research suggests that whereas emotion identification depends on a cortical mirror system that enables the embodiment of observed motor behavior within one's own motor system, causal attribution for emotion depends on a separate cortical mentalizing system, so-named because its function is associated with mental state representation. We used {fMRI} to test an Identification–Attribution model of mirror and mentalizing system contributions to the comprehension of emotional behavior. Normal volunteers watched a set of ecologically valid videos of human emotional displays. During each viewing, volunteers either identified an emotion-relevant motor behavior (explicit identification) or inferred a plausible social cause (explicit attribution). These explicit identification and attribution goals strongly distinguished activity in the mirror and mentalizing systems, respectively. However, frontal mirror areas, though preferentially engaged by the identification goal, nevertheless exhibited activation when observers possessed the attribution goal. One of these areas—right posterior inferior frontal gyrus—demonstrated effective connectivity with areas of the mentalizing system during attributional processing. These results support an integrative model of the neural systems supporting the comprehension of emotional behavior, where the mirror system helps facilitate the rapid identification of emotional expressions that then serve as inputs to attributional processing in the mentalizing system.},

	abstract = {This study examined neural activation during the experience of compassion, an emotion that orients people toward vulnerable others and prompts caregiving, and pride, a self-focused emotion that signals individual strength and heightened status. Functional magnetic resonance images ({fMRI}) were acquired as participants viewed 55 s continuous sequences of slides to induce either compassion or pride, presented in alternation with sequences of neutral slides. Emotion self-report data were collected after each slide condition within the {fMRI} scanner. Compassion induction was associated with activation in the midbrain periaqueductal gray ({PAG}), a region that is activated during pain and the perception of others’ pain, and that has been implicated in parental nurturance behaviors. Pride induction engaged the posterior medial cortex, a region that has been associated with self-referent processing. Self-reports of compassion experience were correlated with increased activation in a region near the {PAG}, and in the right inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}). Self-reports of pride experience, in contrast, were correlated with reduced activation in the {IFG} and the anterior insula. These results provide preliminary evidence towards understanding the neural correlates of important interpersonal dimensions of compassion and pride. Caring (compassion) and self-focus (pride) may represent core appraisals that differentiate the response profiles of many emotions.},

	abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: {AIR}, {ANIMAL}, {ART}, Diffeomorphic Demons, {FNIRT}, {IRTK}, {JRD}-fluid, {ROMEO}, {SICLE}, {SyN}, and four different {SPM}5 algorithms (“{SPM}2-type” and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the {DARTEL} Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using {FLIRT}. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way {ANOVA} tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. {ART}, {SyN}, {IRTK}, and {SPM}'s {DARTEL} Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with {ART} and {SyN} delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets.

On the other hand, Bayesian methods for data analysis have not yet made much headway in cognitive science against the institutionalized inertia of 20th century null hypothesis significance testing ({NHST}). Ironically, specific Bayesian models of cognition and perception may not long endure the ravages of empirical verification, but generic Bayesian methods for data analysis will eventually dominate. It is time that Bayesian data analysis became the norm for empirical methods in cognitive science. This article reviews a fatal flaw of {NHST} and introduces the reader to some benefits of Bayesian data analysis.

All groups, hearing and deaf, processing their native language, English or {ASL}, displayed strong and repeated activation within classical language areas of the left hemisphere. Deaf subjects reading English did not display activation in these regions. These results suggest that the early acquisition of a natural language is important in the expression of the strong bias for these areas to mediate language, independently of the form of the language. In addition, native signers, hearing and deaf, displayed extensive activation of homologous areas within the right hemisphere, indicating that the specific processing requirements of the language also in part determine the organization of the language systems of the brain.},

In light of these results, the authors suggest that the failure of these measures to fit {CFA} models is because of the inherent complexity of personality, issues related to its measurement, and issues related to the application and interpretation of {CFA} models. This leads to three recommendations for researchers interested in the structure and assessment of personality traits: (a) utilize and report on a range of factor analytic methods, (b) avoid global evaluations regarding the internal validity of multiscale personality measures based on model fit according to conventional {CFA} cutoffs, and (c) consider the substantive and practical implications of model modifications designed to improve fit.},

We found that {TMS} impaired subjects' ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect stimulus judgments. Specifically, after {TMS} subjects reported lower visibility levels for correctly identified stimuli, as if they were less fully aware of the quality of their visual information processing. A signal detection theory analysis confirmed that the results reflect a change in metacognitive sensitivity, not just response bias. The effect was specific to metacognition; {TMS} did not change stimulus discrimination performance, ruling out alternative explanations such as {TMS} impairing visual attention. Together these results suggest that activations in the prefrontal cortex in brain imaging experiments on visual awareness are not epiphenomena, but rather may reflect a critical metacognitive process.},

However, the persistence of this association later in development is unknown. Hence, we investigated whether variation in the 5HTTLPR long/short polymorphism modulates brain anatomy in older people with {ASD}. We related 5HTTLPR long/short polymorphism in 43 adolescents and adults with {ASD} to brain anatomy using structural magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. There were no significant associations between brain anatomy and genotype. When considered alongside evidence of a relationship between 5HTTLPR genotype and brain volume amongst children with autism, our findings raise the possibility that the relationship between 5HTTLPR polymorphism and brain anatomy in {ASDs} anatomy may differ as a function of age and/or {ASD} subdiagnosis.},

	abstract = {Summary
Sleep disturbances are often viewed as a secondary symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}), thought to resolve once {PTSD} has been treated. Specific screening, diagnosis and treatment of sleep disturbances is therefore not commonly conducted in trauma centres. However, recent evidence shows that this view and consequent practices are as much unhelpful as incorrect. Several sleep disorders—nightmares, insomnia, sleep apnoea and periodic limb movements—are highly prevalent in {PTSD}, and several studies found disturbed sleep to be a risk factor for the subsequent development of {PTSD}. Moreover, sleep disturbances are a frequent residual complaint after successful {PTSD} treatment: a finding that applies both to psychological and pharmacological treatment. In contrast, treatment focusing on sleep does alleviate both sleep disturbances and {PTSD} symptom severity. A growing body of evidence shows that disturbed sleep is more than a secondary symptom of {PTSD}—it seems to be a core feature. Sleep-focused treatment can be incorporated into any standard {PTSD} treatment, and {PTSD} research needs to start including validated sleep measurements in longitudinal epidemiologic and treatment outcome studies. Further clinical and research implications are discussed, and possible mechanisms for the role of disturbed ({REM}) sleep in {PTSD} are described.},

This study examined {SIP} patterns of prosocial young adolescents (10 through 12 years of age). Hypothetical situation instruments were used to assess the intent attributions, feelings of distress, and response-ecision processes (for relational and instrumental provocation situations) of fourth- through sixth-grade young adoles-cents (N = 675). Results revealed that, in contrast to their comparison group peers, pro-social young adolescents (a) were less likely to attribute hostile intent or feel distressed in provocation situations (i.e., a benign attributional bias), (b) gave relatively more negative evaluations of aggressive responses and relatively more positive evaluations of prosocial responses to provocation, and (c) were more likely to endorse relational rather than instrumental goals in dealing with provocation. Implications for prosocial development and intervention are discussed.},

In relevant studies, people attempt to discriminate lies from truths in real time with no special aids or training. In these circumstances, people achieve an average of 54\% correct lie-truth judgments, correctly classifying 47\% of lies as deceptive and 61\% of truths as nondeceptive. Relative to cross-judge differences in accuracy, mean lie-truth discrimination abilities are nontrivial, with a mean accuracy d of roughly .40. This produces an effect that is at roughly the 60th percentile in size, relative to others that have been meta-analyzed by social psychologists. Alternative indexes of lie-truth discrimination accuracy correlate highly with percentage correct, and rates of lie detection vary little from study to study. Our meta-analyses reveal that people are more accurate in judging audible than visible lies, that people appear deceptive when motivated to be believed, and that individuals regard their interaction partners as honest. We propose that people judge others' deceptions more harshly than their own and that this double standard in evaluating deceit can explain much of the accumulated literature.},

Traditional neurobiological and cognitive explanations for such suboptimal choices and actions have failed to account for nonlinear changes in behavior observed during adolescence, relative to childhood and adulthood. This review provides a biologically plausible conceptualization of the mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior, as an imbalance between a heightened sensitivity to motivational cues and immature cognitive control. Recent human imaging and animal studies provide a biological basis for this view, suggesting differential development of subcortical limbic systems relative to top-down control systems during adolescence relative to childhood and adulthood. This work emphasizes the importance of examining transitions into and out of adolescence and highlights emerging avenues of future research on adolescent brain development.},

	abstract = {Sleep deprivation severely compromises the ability of human beings to respond to stimuli in a timely fashion. These deficits have been attributed in large part to failures of vigilant attention, which many theorists believe forms the bedrock of the other more complex components of cognition. One of the leading paradigms used as an assay of vigilant attention is the psychomotor vigilance test ({PVT}), a high signal-load reaction-time test that is extremely sensitive to sleep deprivation. Over the last twenty years, four dominant findings have emerged from the use of this paradigm. First, sleep deprivation results in an overall slowing of responses. Second, sleep deprivation increases the propensity of individuals to lapse for lengthy periods ({\textgreater}500 ms), as well as make errors of commission. Third, sleep deprivation enhances the time-on-task effect within each test bout. Finally, {PVT} results during extended periods of wakefulness reveal the presence of interacting circadian and homeostatic sleep drives. A theme that links these findings is the interplay of “top-down” and “bottom-up” attention in producing the unstable and unpredictable patterns of behavior that are the hallmark of the sleep-deprived state.},

Individual differences in the tendency to analytically override initially flawed intuitions in reasoning were associated with increased religious disbelief. Four additional experiments provided evidence of causation, as subtle manipulations known to trigger analytic processing also encouraged religious disbelief. Combined, these studies indicate that analytic processing is one factor (presumably among several) that promotes religious disbelief.

They attributed this finding to increased positive affect. To determine whether such results actually stem in general from positive affect or from other more specific properties of humor, we conducted an experiment with moral dilemmas presented during an interleaved emotion-induction procedure involving mirth and another positive emotion, elevation. Mirth increased permissiveness for deontological violations, whereas elevation had the opposite effect. Furthermore, affective valence had no apparent independent influence on these judgments. Our results suggest that mirth and elevation have distinct cognitive consequences whose properties reflect their respective social functions, not their shared positive valence.},

Nevertheless, Lamme understands consciousness as a subjective phenomenon, and introspection as the way in which we acquire knowledge about consciousness. This makes the task to find introspective-free methods to study consciousness difficult. Lamme attempts to make progress by introducing “neural arguments,” but fails to show how such arguments are independent of introspective methods which seem necessary in order to decide how any neural process relates to mental phenomena. This commentary paper thus aims to show that our understanding of neural correlates is shaped by introspection.},

We tested this hypothesis in two studies where we had participants envision circumstances that could serve to mitigate an otherwise wrongful act. In Study 1, participants provided moral judgements, and ratings of anger and disgust, to a number of transgressions involving either harm or bodily purity. They were then asked to imagine and report whether there might be any circumstances that would make it all right to perform the act. Across transgression type, and controlling for covariance between anger and disgust, levels of anger were found to negatively predict the envisioning of mitigating circumstances for wrongdoing, while disgust was unrelated. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings to less serious transgressions, using a continuous measure of mitigating circumstances, and demonstrated the impact of anger independent of deontological commitments. These findings highlight the differential relationship that anger and disgust have with the ability to envision mitigating factors.},

Intuitive theories of adolescent development, based in part on animal work, suggest that puberty is associated with neural-level changes that facilitate a “social reorientation” (Nelson et al., 2005). However, direct tests of this hypothesis using neuroimaging are limited in humans. This longitudinal {fMRI} study examined neurodevelopmental trajectories associated with puberty, self-evaluations, and the presumed social reorientation during the transition from childhood to adolescence. Participants (N = 27, mean age = 10.1 and 13.1 years at time points one and two, respectively) engaged in trait evaluations of two targets (the self and a familiar fictional other), across two domains of competence (social and academic). Responses in ventromedial {PFC} increased with both age and pubertal development during self-evaluations in the social domain, but not in the academic domain. These results suggest that changes in social self-evaluations are intimately connected with biology, not just peer contexts, and provide important empirical support for the relationship between neurodevelopment, puberty, and social functioning.},

To investigate functional neural plasticity underlying the augmentation of empathy and to test the counteracting potential of compassion, one group of participants was first trained in empathic resonance and subsequently in compassion. In response to videos depicting human suffering, empathy training, but not memory training (control group), increased negative affect and brain activations in anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex—brain regions previously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast, subsequent compassion training could reverse the increase in negative effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In addition, compassion training increased activations in a non-overlapping brain network spanning ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathic distress and strengthen resilience.},

Indeed, the hypothesis that the agent believes in may be more likely to be wrong than right.

	abstract = {Neanderthal dietary reconstructions have, to date, been based on indirect evidence and may underestimate the significance of plants as a food source. While zooarchaeological and stable isotope data have conveyed an image of Neanderthals as largely carnivorous, studies on dental calculus and scattered palaeobotanical evidence suggest some degree of contribution of plants to their diet. However, both views remain plausible and there is no categorical indication of an omnivorous diet. Here we present direct evidence of Neanderthal diet using faecal biomarkers, a valuable analytical tool for identifying dietary provenance. Our gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results from El Salt (Spain), a Middle Palaeolithic site dating to ca. 50,000 yr. {BP}, represents the oldest positive identification of human faecal matter. We show that Neanderthals, like anatomically modern humans, have a high rate of conversion of cholesterol to coprostanol related to the presence of required bacteria in their guts. Analysis of five sediment samples from different occupation floors suggests that Neanderthals predominantly consumed meat, as indicated by high coprostanol proportions, but also had significant plant intake, as shown by the presence of 5β-stigmastanol. This study highlights the applicability of the biomarker approach in Pleistocene contexts as a provider of direct palaeodietary information and supports the opportunity for further research into cholesterol metabolism throughout human evolution.},

	abstract = {Applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) have provided novel insights into the neuropathophysiology of major psychiatric, neurological, and substance abuse disorders and their treatments. Modern activation studies often compare localized task-induced changes in brain activity between experimental groups. Complementary approaches consider the ensemble of voxels constituting an anatomically defined region of interest ({ROI}) or summary statistics, such as means or quantiles, of the {ROI}. In this work, we present a Bayesian extension of voxel-level analyses that offers several notable benefits. Among these, it combines whole-brain voxel-by-voxel modeling and {ROI} analyses within a unified framework. Secondly, an unstructured variance/covariance matrix for regional mean parameters allows for the study of inter-regional (long-range) correlations, and the model employs an exchangeable correlation structure to capture intra-regional (short-range) correlations. Estimation is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) techniques implemented via Gibbs sampling. We apply our Bayesian hierarchical model to two novel {fMRI} data sets: one considering inhibitory control in cocaine-dependent men and the second considering verbal memory in subjects at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease.},

Recently, {ToM} was suggested to consist of two processes: (1) self-perspective inhibition and (2) belief reasoning. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that self-perspective inhibition may build upon basic motor response inhibition. This study tested both hypotheses for the first time using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}), through administering both a {ToM} and a stop-signal paradigm in the same subjects. Both self-perspective and motor response inhibition yielded bilateral inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}) activation, suggesting a common inhibitory mechanism, while belief reasoning was mediated by the superior temporal gyrus ({STG}) and temporo-parietal junction ({TPJ}). Thus, we provide neurobiological evidence for a subdivision of {ToM} into self-perspective inhibition and belief reasoning. Furthermore, evidence for partially shared neural mechanisms for inhibition in complex social situations and basic motor response inhibition was found.},

This longitudinal study investigated changes in the mean levels and rank order of the Big Five personality traits in a heterogeneous sample of 14,718 Germans across all of adulthood. Latent change and latent moderated regression models provided 4 main findings: First, age had a complex curvilinear influence on mean levels of personality. Second, the rank-order stability of Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness, and Agreeableness all followed an inverted U-shaped function, reaching a peak between the ages of 40 and 60 and decreasing afterward, whereas Conscientiousness showed a continuously increasing rank-order stability across adulthood. Third, personality predicted the occurrence of several objective major life events (selection effects) and changed in reaction to experiencing these events (socialization effects), suggesting that personality can change due to factors other than intrinsic maturation. Fourth, when events were clustered according to their valence, as is commonly done, effects of the environment on changes in personality were either overlooked or overgeneralized. In sum, our analyses show that personality changes throughout the life span, but with more pronounced changes in young and old ages, and that this change is partly attributable to social demands and experiences.},

The quality of children’s motivational beliefs deteriorated over the 7th and 8th grades (e.g., children became less mastery oriented) in both the United States and China. American children also valued academics less, with declines in their motivational behavior as well. Chinese children continued to value academics, sustaining their motivational behavior.

While {AE} is selectively disrupted in psychopathy, autism is associated with deficits in {CE}. Despite such dissociations, {AE} and {CE} together contribute to normal human empathic experience. A dimensional measure of individual differences in {AE} ‘relative to’ {CE} captures this interaction and may reveal brain–behavior relationships beyond those detectable with {AE} and {CE} separately. Using resting-state {fMRI} and measures of empathy in healthy adults, we show that relative empathic ability ({REA}) is reflected in the brain's intrinsic functional dynamics. Dominance of {AE} was associated with stronger functional connectivity among social–emotional regions (ventral anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, perigenual anterior cingulate). Dominance of {CE} was related to stronger connectivity among areas implicated in interoception, autonomic monitoring and social–cognitive processing (brainstem, superior temporal sulcus, ventral anterior insula). These patterns were distinct from those observed with {AE} and {CE} separately. Finally, {REA} and the strength of several functional connections were associated with symptoms of psychopathology. These findings suggest that {REA} provides a dimensional index of empathic function and pathological tendencies in healthy adults, which are reflected in the intrinsic functional dynamics of neural systems associated with social and emotional cognition.},

A double dissociation was found: On the one hand, there was a selective relation between parental nurturance and memory development, consistent with the animal literature on maternal buffering of stress hormone effects on hippocampal development. On the other hand, there was a selective relation between environmental stimulation and language development. The relevance of these findings to socioeconomic gradients in cognitive ability is discussed.},

We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants’ Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher interjudge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.},

	shorttitle = {Who caused the pain?},
	abstract = {When we attend to other people in pain, the neural circuits underpinning the processing of first-hand experience of pain are activated in the observer. This basic somatic sensorimotor resonance plays a critical role in the primitive building block of empathy and moral reasoning that relies on the sharing of others’ distress. However, the full-blown capacity of human empathy is more sophisticated than the mere simulation of the target's affective state. Indeed, empathy is about both sharing and understanding the emotional state of others in relation to oneself. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) study, 17 typically developing children (range 7–12 yr) were scanned while presented with short animated visual stimuli depicting painful and non-painful situations. These situations involved either a person whose pain was accidentally caused or a person whose pain was intentionally inflicted by another individual. After scanning, children rated how painful these situations appeared. Consistent with previous {fMRI} studies of pain empathy with adults, the perception of other people in pain in children was associated with increased hemodynamic activity in the neural circuits involved in the processing of first-hand experience of pain, including the insula, somatosensory cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, and supplementary motor area. Interestingly, when watching another person inflicting pain onto another, regions that are consistently engaged in representing social interaction and moral behavior (the temporo-parietal junction, the paracingulate, orbital medial frontal cortices, amygdala) were additionally recruited, and increased their connectivity with the fronto-parietal attention network. These results are important to set the standard for future studies with children who exhibit social cognitive disorders (e.g., antisocial personality disorder, conduct disorder) and are often deficient in experiencing empathy or guilt.},

I describe recent empirical research illuminating “the affect heuristic” wherein people rapidly consult their affective feelings, when making judgments and decisions. This heuristic enables us to be rational actors in many situations. It works beautifully when experience enables us to anticipate accurately how we will like or dislike the consequences of our decisions. However, it fails miserably when the consequences turn out to be much different than we anticipated. In the latter circumstances, the rational actor may well become the rational fool.},

Activation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({dmPFC}) tracked the discrepancy between one’s own preference and its social ideal and was associated with subsequent preference change (toward the liked and away from the disliked group), even several months later. A follow-up study found overlapping activation in this same region of {dmPFC} with negative monetary outcomes, but no overlap with nearby activations induced by response conflict. A single social encounter can thus result in long-lasting preference change, a mechanism that recruits {dmPFC} and that may reflect the aversive nature of cognitive imbalance.},

In our neurovisceral integration model we have tried to build on this pioneering work. In the present paper we further elaborate our model and update it with recent results. Specifically, we performed a meta-analysis of recent neuroimaging studies on the relationship between heart rate variability and regional cerebral blood flow. We identified a number of regions, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, in which significant associations across studies were found. We further propose that the default response to uncertainty is the threat response and may be related to the well known negativity bias. Heart rate variability may provide an index of how strongly ‘top–down’ appraisals, mediated by cortical-subcortical pathways, shape brainstem activity and autonomic responses in the body. If the default response to uncertainty is the threat response, as we propose here, contextual information represented in ‘appraisal’ systems may be necessary to overcome this bias during daily life. Thus, {HRV} may serve as a proxy for ‘vertical integration’ of the brain mechanisms that guide flexible control over behavior with peripheral physiology, and as such provides an important window into understanding stress and health.},

	abstract = {Little research to date has examined the ability of self-report measures to assess changes in symptom severity and diagnostic status as a function of treatment. This study investigated the validity of the posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) checklist ({PCL}) as a measure of symptomatic change following programmatic treatment. A sample of 97 Vietnam veterans with combat-related {PTSD} was assessed using the clinician-administered {PTSD} scale ({CAPS}) and the {PCL} prior to, and 9 months following, participation in a {PTSD} treatment program. Using the {CAPS} as the “gold standard” measure of {PTSD} symptomatology, the {PCL} demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy pre- and posttreatment. However, significant variations in accuracy were evident in the ability of the {PCL} to determine the presence and severity of individual symptoms at each time point. In addition, as symptoms improved from pre- to posttreatment, and approached the threshold criteria, the {PCL} demonstrated reductions in diagnostic accuracy. As a measure of overall symptomatic change, the {PCL} underrated improvement in comparison to the {CAPS}. The results supported the use of an overall cut-off score of 50 on the {PCL} for a diagnosis, and an item score of 3 for symptom criterion, in this population.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) is a powerful tool for examining brain function but has yet to be systematically applied to the study of brain development in autism. Recently, however, scientists have begun to apply {fMRI} during natural sleep as a mechanism to study function in the developing brain. When considering the study of autism, this method opens considerable doors because it eliminates biases of past studies which only sampled from high-functioning, older populations. This paper describes the application of sleep {fMRI} as a way to study both extrinsic and intrinsic brain functions in autism between 12 and 36\&\#xa0;months. Preliminary studies that use sleep {fMRI} method show that defects in the superior temporal gyrus ({STG}) in response to language are early emerging in autism and can be found in as young as 14\&\#xa0;months in age. As such indices of abnormal early development of the {STG} may prove useful in the search for a biomarker of autism detectable during the infancy period. From a theoretical standpoint, examining sleep {fMRI} studies in autism gains some clarity when placed in context of the more established literature on structural brain development of autism which suggests that autism involves early brain overgrowth. Studies of plasticity in autism have yet to be done, but it is likely that the window of opportunity for altering the course of brain development in autism begins within the first year of life. The ability to do so relies on improving and streamlining early identification and thus early treatment efforts.},

	abstract = {Although the amygdala complex is a brain area critical for human behavior, knowledge of its subspecialization is primarily derived from experiments in animals. We here employed methods for large-scale data mining to perform a connectivity-derived parcellation of the human amygdala based on whole-brain coactivation patterns computed for each seed voxel. Voxels within the histologically defined human amygdala were clustered into distinct groups based on their brain-wide coactivation maps. Using this approach, connectivity-based parcellation divided the amygdala into three distinct clusters that are highly consistent with earlier microstructural distinctions. Meta-analytic connectivity modelling then revealed the derived clusters' brain-wide connectivity patterns, while meta-data profiling allowed their functional characterization. These analyses revealed that the amygdala's laterobasal nuclei group was associated with coordinating high-level sensory input, whereas its centromedial nuclei group was linked to mediating attentional, vegetative, and motor responses. The often-neglected superficial nuclei group emerged as particularly sensitive to olfactory and probably social information processing. The results of this model-free approach support the concordance of structural, connectional, and functional organization in the human amygdala and point to the importance of acknowledging the heterogeneity of this region in neuroimaging research.

In line with this proposal, a pragmatic approach to person perception is presented that emphasizes the interpersonal aspects of person perception, particularly those whereby perceivers and targets negotiate the identities that targets are to assume during their interactions. A major implication of this formulation is that contemporary accounts underestimate the accuracy of the person perception process. It is concluded that past treatments of the person perception process are limited and misleading because theorists and researchers have refrained from considering the uniquely social aspects of that process. Research may wish to devote more attention to the manner in which this process is woven into the fabric of people's ongoing social relationships. (4¼ p ref)},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Individual differences in personality may be described at three different levels. Level I consists of those broad, de contextualized, and relatively non conditional constructs called “traits,” which provide a dispositional signature for personality description. No description of a person is adequate without trait attributions, but trait attributions themselves yield little beyond a “psychology of the stranger.” At Level {II} (called “personal concerns”), personality descriptions invoke personal strivings, life tasks, defense mechanisms, coping strategies, domain-specific skills and values, and a wide assortment of other motivational, developmental, or strategic constructs that are contextualized in time, place, or role. While dispositional traits and personal concerns appear to have near-universal applicability. Level {III} presents frameworks and constructs that may be uniquely relevant to adulthood only, and perhaps only within modern societies that put a premium on the individuation of the self. Thus, in contemporary Western societies, a full description of personality commonly requires a consideration of the extent to which a human life expresses unity and purpose, which are the hallmarks of identity. Identity in adulthood is an inner story of the self that integrates the reconstructed past, perceived present, and anticipated future to provide a life with unity, purpose, and meaning. At Level {III}, psychologists may explore the person's identity as an internalized and evolving life story. Each of the three levels has its own geography and requires its own indigenous nomenclatures, taxonomies, theories, frameworks, and laws.},

First, we provide a brief review of the neural bases of selective attention, emphasizing the effects of selective attention on neural processing, as well as the neural systems important to deploying selective attention and managing response conflict. Second, we examine the developmental time course of selective attention. It is argued that developmental differences in selective attention are related to the neural systems important for deploying selective attention and managing response conflict. In contrast, once effectively deployed, selective attention acts through very similar neural mechanisms across ages. In the third section, we relate the processes of selective attention to three domains important to academic foundations: language, literacy, and mathematics. Fourth, drawing on recent literatures on the effects of video-game play and mind-brain training on selective attention, we discuss the possibility of training selective attention. The final section examines the application of these principles to educationally-focused attention-training programs for children.},

This study investigated the neural dynamics of reappraisal of emotional responses in 28 participants who differed with respect to {IA}. Electroencephalography was used to characterize the time course of emotion regulation. We found that reappraisal was accompanied by reduced arousal and significant modulation of late neural responses. What is more, higher {IA} facilitated downregulation of affect and was associated with more pronounced modulation of underlying neural activity. Therefore, we conclude that {IA} not only advances the consolidation of somatic markers required for guiding individual behaviour but also creates processing advantages in tasks referring to these bodily markers.},

	abstract = {An explication of the neural substrates for social perception is an important component in the emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience and is relevant to the field of cognitive neuroscience as a whole. Prior studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that passive viewing of biological motion (Pelphrey, Mitchell, et al., 2003; Puce et al., 1998) activates the posterior superior temporal sulcus ({STS}) region. Furthermore, recent evidence has shown that the perceived context of observed gaze shifts (Pelphrey, Singerman, et al., 2003; Pelphrey et al., 2004) modulates {STS} activity. Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging at 4 T, we investigated brain activity in response to passive viewing of goal- and non-goal- directed reaching-to-grasp movements. Participants viewed an animated character making reaching-to-grasp movements either toward (correct) or away (incorrect) from a blinking dial. Both conditions evoked significant posterior {STS} activity that was strongly right lateralized. By examining the time course of the blood oxygenation level-dependent response from areas of activation, we observed a functional dissociation. Incorrect trials evoked significantly greater activity in the {STS} than did correct trials, while an area posterior and inferior to the {STS} (likely corresponding to the {MT}/V5 complex) responded equally to correct and incorrect movements. Parietal cortical regions, including the superior parietal lobule and the anterior intraparietal sulcus, also responded equally to correct and incorrect movements, but showed evidence for differential responding based on the hand and arm (left or right) of the animated character used to make the reaching-to-grasp movement. The results of this study further suggest that a region of the right posterior {STS} is involved in analyzing the intentions of other people's actions and that activity in this region is sensitive to the context of observed biological motions.},

	abstract = {A category of stimuli of great importance for primates, humans in particular, is that formed by actions done by other individuals. If we want to survive, we must understand the actions of others. Furthermore, without action understanding, social organization is impossible. In the case of humans, there is another faculty that depends on the observation of others' actions: imitation learning. Unlike most species, we are able to learn by imitation, and this faculty is at the basis of human culture. In this review we present data on a neurophysiological mechanism—the mirror-neuron mechanism—that appears to play a fundamental role in both action understanding and imitation. We describe first the functional properties of mirror neurons in monkeys. We review next the characteristics of the mirror-neuron system in humans. We stress, in particular, those properties specific to the human mirror-neuron system that might explain the human capacity to learn by imitation. We conclude by discussing the relationship between the mirror-neuron system and language.},

Two general varieties of theoretical models are considered: models in which the time-related change of primary interest is continuous, and those in which it is characterized by movement between discrete states. In addition, two general types of temporal designs are considered: the longitudinal panel design and the intensive longitudinal design. For each general category of theoretical models, some of the analytic possibilities available for longitudinal panel designs and for intensive longitudinal designs are discussed. The article concludes with brief discussions of two issues particularly relevant to longitudinal research—missing data and measurement—and a few words about exploratory research.},

	abstract = {Review of neurochemical investigations in autistic disorder revealed that a wide array of transmitter systems have been studied, including serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, oxytocin, endogenous opioids, cortisol, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}). These studies have been complicated by the fact that autism is a very heterogeneous disorder which often presents with comorbid behavioral problems. In addition, many of these studies employed very small samples and inappropriate control groups, making it difficult to draw conclusions with confidence. Overall, serotonin appears to have the most empirical evidence for a role in autism, but this requires further investigation and replication. There is little support for the notion that a dysfunction of norepinephrine or the endogenous opioids are related to autism. The role of dopaminergic functioning has not been compelling thus far, though conflicting findings on central dopamine turnover require further study. Promising new areas of study may include possible dysfunction of the cholinergic system, oxytocin, and amino acid neurotransmitters. Implications for pharmacotherapy are briefly discussed for each neurotransmitter system with brief research examples. Review of this work emphasizes the need for future studies to control for subject variables, such as race, sex, pubertal status, and distress associated with blood draws, which can affect measures of neurochemical function. In addition, research in neurochemistry must continue to work in concert with other subspecialties to form a more comprehensive and theory-based approach to the neurobiological correlates of autistic disorder.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the relationships between brain serotonergic turnover and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis function in unipolar depression, the authors measured intact adrenocorticotropic hormone ({ACTH}) and cortisol levels in baseline conditions and after combined dexamethasone (1 mg {PO}) and L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-{HTP}, 200 mg {PO}) administration in 13 minor, 17 simple major, and 17 melancholic subjects. L-5-{HTP} significantly enhanced post-{DST} {ACTH} and cortisol secretion in majorâ€”but not in minorâ€”depressed subjects. Major depressed subjects with or without melancholia exhibited significantly higher post-{DST} {ACTH} and cortisol responses to L-5-{HTP} than minor depressed subjects. L-5-{HTP} administration converted some major depressed {ACTH} or cortisol suppressors into nonsuppressors. L-5-{HTP} stimulated {ACTH} or cortisol secretion to the same extent in major depressed {HPA}-axis suppressors and nonsuppressors. It is concluded that L-5-{HTP} loading may augment {ACTH} and, consequently, cortisol escape from suppression by dexamethasone in major but not in minor depressed subjects. The findings show that serotonergic mechanisms modulate the negative feedback of glucocorticoids on central {HPA}-axis regulation. It is hypothesized that the higher L-5-{HTP}-induced post-{DST} {HPA}-axis hormone responses in major depression reflect upregulated 5-{HT}2 receptor-driven breakthrough secretion of pituitary {ACTH} from suppression by dexamethasone.},

For the critical case of language, conflicting answers arise from the neuropsychological literature, which features striking dissociations between deficits in linguistic and nonlinguistic abilities, vs. the neuroimaging literature, which has argued for overlap between activations for linguistic and nonlinguistic processes, including arithmetic, domain general abilities like cognitive control, and music. Here, we use functional {MRI} to define classic language regions functionally in each subject individually and then examine the response of these regions to the nonlinguistic functions most commonly argued to engage these regions: arithmetic, working memory, cognitive control, and music. We find little or no response in language regions to these nonlinguistic functions. These data support a clear distinction between language and other cognitive processes, resolving the prior conflict between the neuropsychological and neuroimaging literatures.},

	abstract = {Social neuro-science has recently started to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying our ability to understand the mental and emotional states of others. In this review, imaging research conducted on theory of mind ({ToM} or mentalizing) and empathy is selectively reviewed. It is proposed that even though these abilities are often used as synonyms in the literature these capacities represent different abilities that rely on different neuronal circuitry. {ToM} refers to our ability to understand mental states such as intentions, goals and beliefs, and relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex. In contrast, empathy refers to our ability to share the feelings (emotions and sensations) of others and relies on sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures. It is further argued that the concept of empathy as used in lay terms refers to a multi-level construct extending from simple forms of emotion contagion to complex forms of cognitive perspective taking. Future research should investigate the relative contribution of empathizing and mentalizing abilities in the understanding of other people's states. Finally, it is suggested that the abilities to understand other people's thoughts and to share their affects display different ontogenetic trajectories reflecting the different developmental paths of their underlying neural structures. In particular, empathy develops much earlier than mentalizing abilities, because the former relys on limbic structures which develop early in ontogeny, whereas the latter rely on lateral temporal lobe and pre-frontal structures which are among the last to fully mature.},

Findings also revealed contrasting patterns of peer group leadership. The more conventional, positive leadership style predicted lower rates, and the less mainstream, unconventional style predicted higher rates of involvement in problem behaviors. Conventional leaders were most likely to be popular status youth, while unconventional leaders were mostly to be both controversial and popular status youth.

	abstract = {Abstract:  Adaptation in the face of potentially stressful challenges involves activation of neural, neuroendocrine and neuroendocrine-immune mechanisms. This has been called “allostasis” or “stability through change” by Sterling and Eyer (Fisher S., Reason J. (eds): Handbook of Life Stress, Cognition and Health. J. Wiley Ltd. 1988, p. 631), and allostasis is an essential component of maintaining homeostasis. When these adaptive systems are turned on and turned off again efficiently and not too frequently, the body is able to cope effectively with challenges that it might not otherwise survive. However, there are a number of circumstances in which allostatic systems may either be overstimulated or not perform normally, and this condition has been termed “allostatic load” or the price of adaptation ({McEwen} and Stellar, Arch. Int. Med. 1993; 153:2093.). Allostatic load can lead to disease over long periods. Types of allostatic load include (1) frequent activation of allostatic systems; (2) failure to shut off allostatic activity after stress; (3) inadequate response of allostatic systems leading to elevated activity of other, normally counter-regulated allostatic systems after stress. Examples will be given for each type of allostatic load from research pertaining to autonomic, {CNS}, neuroendocrine, and immune system activity. The relationship of allostatic load to genetic and developmental predispositions to disease is also considered.},

As part of the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth—1979 ({CNLSY}-79), 740 adolescents provided data at two-year intervals between 1994 and 2004. Latent growth models revealed quadratic growth in youths' sexual risk taking. High initial levels of risk were attributable to early adolescent family structure, the expectation of teenage parenthood, early autonomy from parents, young age at dating initiation, and delinquency. Linear and quadratic growth terms were explained by early adolescent family structure, perceived academic competence, substance use, and delinquency. These associations persisted when time-varying covariates of other contraceptive use and relationship status were modeled.},

	abstract = {Functional imaging studies of emotional processing typically contain neutral control conditions that serve to remove simple effects of visual perception, thus revealing the additional emotional process. Here we seek to identify similarities and differences across 100 studies of emotional face processing and 57 studies of emotional scene processing, using a coordinate-based meta-analysis technique. The overlay of significant meta-analyses resulted in extensive overlap in clusters, coupled with offset and unique clusters of reliable activity. The area of greatest overlap is the amygdala, followed by regions of medial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, and extrastriate occipital cortex. Emotional face-specific clusters were identified in regions known to be involved in face processing, including anterior fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, and emotional scene studies were uniquely associated with lateral occipital cortex, as well as pulvinar and the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. One global result of the meta-analysis reveals that a class of visual stimuli (faces vs. scenes) has a considerable impact on the resulting emotion effects, even after removing the basic visual perception effects through subtractive contrasts. Pure effects of emotion may thus be difficult to remove for the particular class of stimuli employed in an experimental paradigm. Whether a researcher chooses to tightly control the various elements of the emotional stimuli, as with posed face photographs, or allow variety and environmental realism into their evocative stimuli, as with natural scenes, will depend on the desired generalizability of their results.},

Using the transmission disequilibrium test ({TDT}), no disorder-specific preferential transmission of promoter (long and short) or intron 2 (10- and 12-repeat) alleles was observed. However, multivariate analysis of continuous autism-related behavioral measures revealed that subjects with intron 2 12/12 genotype were significantly more impaired in the rigid-compulsive domain (P = 0.008). Quantitative {TDT} ({QTDT}) analysis also showed significant association of the intron 2 {VNTR} 12-repeat allele with rigid-compulsive behavior (P = 0.015).

	abstract = {Putting feelings into words (affect labeling) has long been thought to help manage negative emotional experiences; however, the mechanisms by which affect labeling produces this benefit remain largely unknown. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest a possible neurocognitive pathway for this process, but methodological limitations of previous studies have prevented strong inferences from being drawn. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study of affect labeling was conducted to remedy these limitations. The results indicated that affect labeling, relative to other forms of encoding, diminished the response of the amygdala and other limbic regions to negative emotional images. Additionally, affect labeling produced increased activity in a single brain region, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({RVLPFC}). Finally, {RVLPFC} and amygdala activity during affect labeling were inversely correlated, a relationship that was mediated by activity in medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}). These results suggest that affect labeling may diminish emotional reactivity along a pathway from {RVLPFC} to {MPFC} to the amygdala.},

	abstract = {The brain stores information in an associative manner so that contextually related entities are connected in memory. Such associative representations mediate the brain’s ability to generate predictions about which other objects and events to expect in a given context. Likewise, the brain encodes and is able to rapidly retrieve the affective value of stimuli in our environment. That both contextual associations and affect serve as building blocks of numerous mental functions often makes interpretation of brain activation ambiguous. A critical brain region where such activation has often resulted in equivocal interpretation is the medial orbitofrontal cortex ({mOFC}), which has been implicated separately in both affective and associative processing. To characterize its role more unequivocally, we tested whether activity in the {mOFC} was most directly attributable to affective processing, associative processing, or a combination of both. Subjects performed an object recognition task while undergoing {fMRI} scans. Objects varied independently in their affective valence and in their degree of association with other objects (associativity). Analyses revealed an overlapping sensitivity whereby the left {mOFC} responded both to increasingly positive affective value and to stronger associativity. These two properties individually accounted for {mOFC} response, even after controlling for their interrelationship. The role of the {mOFC} is either general enough to encompass associations that link stimuli both with reinforcing outcomes and with other stimuli or abstract enough to use both valence and associativity in conjunction to inform downstream processes related to perception and action. These results may further point to a fundamental relationship between associativity and positive affect.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that multiple genetic variants, within the same or different genes, combine to affect liability for many common diseases. Indeed, the variants may interact among themselves and with environmental factors. Thus realistic genetic/statistical models can include an extremely large number of parameters, and it is by no means obvious how to find the variants contributing to liability. For models of multiple candidate genes and their interactions, we prove that statistical inference can be based on controlling the false discovery rate ({FDR}), which is defined as the expected number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections. Controlling the {FDR} automatically controls the overall error rate in the special case that all the null hypotheses are true. So do more standard methods such as Bonferroni correction. However, when some null hypotheses are false, the goals of Bonferroni and {FDR} differ, and {FDR} will have better power. Model selection procedures, such as forward stepwise regression, are often used to choose important predictors for complex models. By analysis of simulations of such models, we compare a computationally efficient form of forward stepwise regression against the {FDR} methods. We show that model selection includes numerous genetic variants having no impact on the trait, whereas {FDR} maintains a false-positive rate very close to the nominal rate. With good control over false positives and better power than Bonferroni, the {FDR}-based methods we introduce present a viable means of evaluating complex, multivariate genetic models. Naturally, as for any method seeking to explore complex genetic models, the power of the methods is limited by sample size and model complexity.

However, effect sizes are rarely fixed in psychological research: Study design choices, such as the operationalization of the dependent variable or the treatment manipulation, the social context, the subject pool, or the time of day, typically cause systematic variation in the effect size. Ignoring this between-study variation, as standard power formulae do, results in assessments of power that are too optimistic. Consequently, when researchers attempting replication set sample sizes using these formulae, their studies will be underpowered and will thus fail at a greater than expected rate. We illustrate this with both hypothetical examples and data on several well-studied phenomena in psychology. We provide formulae that account for between-study variation and suggest that researchers set sample sizes with respect to our generally more conservative formulae. Our formulae generalize to settings in which there are multiple effects of interest. We also introduce an easy-to-use website that implements our approach to setting sample sizes. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for quantifying between-study variation.},

Unlike the {LRT} and Δ{CFI} methods, which need a different model estimation per item, the {BC} bootstrap confidence intervals approach can examine item-level {ME}/I tests using a single model. This method greatly simplifies the search for an invariant item as the reference indicator in the factor-ratio test. Also demonstrated here is how the factor-ratio test and the list-and-delete method can be extended from the metric invariance test to the scalar invariance test.

	abstract = {Michael Sobel sent me this paper which will appear in the Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics.  It's about mediation:  a crucial issue in causal inference and a difficult issue to think about.  The usual rhetorical options here are:

- Blithe acceptance of structural equation models (of the form, "we ran the analysis and found that A mediates the effects of X on Y")

- Blanket dismissal (of the form, "estimating mediation requires uncheckable assumptions, so we won't do it")

- Claims of technological wizardry (of the form, "with our new method you can estimate mediation from observational data")

For example, in our book, Jennifer and I illustrate that regression estimates of mediation make strong assumptions, and we vaguely suggest that something better might come along.  We don't provide any solutions or even much guidance.

Michael has thought hard about these problems for a long time.  (For example, see here and here, or for some laffs, here.)  Michael's also notorious for pointing out that the phrase "causal effect" is redundant:  all effects are causal.  Anyway, I was interested to see what he has to say about mediation.

Third through 6th graders (N = 76; 46 boys, 30 girls) completed self-reports on agreeableness (based on the adult version of the {NEO} Personality inventory Manual; Costa \& {McCrae}, 1985), social skills (Social Skills Rating System for Children; Gresham \& Elliot, 1991), empathy (Feshbach, 1990) and trust (Children's Trust Scale; Imber, 1973). Using multiple regression, agreeableness was predicted by social skills, empathy, and trust for girls. There were no significant predictors of agreeableness for boys. The discussion focuses on the mutability of childhood personality. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

Recent research in social cognition suggests that “warmth,” broadly construed, should be of prime importance in impression formation. Yet, some prior research suggests that information about others’ specifically moral traits—their moral “character”—may be a primary dimension. Although warmth and character have sometimes been conceived of as interchangeable, we argue that they are separable, and that across a wide variety of contexts, character is usually more important than warmth in impression formation. We first showed that moral character and social warmth traits are indeed separable (Studies 1 and 2). Further studies that used correlational and experimental methods showed that, as predicted, in most contexts, moral character information is more important in impression formation than is warmth information (Studies 2–6). Character information was also more important than warmth information with respect to judgments of traits’ perceived fundamentalness to identity, their uniquely human quality, their context-independence, and their controllability (Study 2). Finally, Study 7 used an archival method to show that moral character information appears more prominently than warmth information in obituaries, and more strongly determines the impressions people form of the individuals described in those obituaries. We discuss implications for current theories of person perception and social cognition.},

Together with lesion data, the {IFO} has thus been proposed to be crucial in processing disgust-related stimuli. Here, we examined {IFO} involvement in the processing of other people’s gustatory emotions more generally by exposing participants to food-related disgusted, pleased and neutral facial expressions during functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). We then exposed participants to pleasant, unpleasant and neutral tastants for the purpose of mapping their gustatory {IFO}. Finally, we associated participants’ self reported empathy (measured using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, {IRI}) with their {IFO} activation during the witnessing of others’ gustatory emotions. We show that participants’ empathy scores were predictive of their gustatory {IFO} activation while witnessing both the pleased and disgusted facial expression of others. While the {IFO} has been implicated in the processing of negative emotions of others and empathy for negative experiences like pain, our finding extends this concept to empathy for intense positive feelings, and provides empirical support for the view that the {IFO} contributes to empathy by mapping the bodily feelings of others onto the internal bodily states of the observer, in agreement with the putative interoceptive function of the {IFO}.},

Results indicated that parents' behaviors in the discussion task were related to both children's emotional and social competence. Both mothers' and fathers' behaviors were linked to children's emotional regulatory abilities and social competence. In addition, children's emotional regulation was related to children's social competence. Only limited evidence of the mediating role of emotion regulation was found.

	abstract = {Salivary cortisol is often used in occupational field studies when measuring stress reactions. For purposes of precision and accuracy in measurement, and interpretation of results, it is crucial to know the sources of variability that exert systematic influence on sampling. Variability can be both biological and methodological in origin, and failure to identify its sources may induce erroneous interpretations of Type I and Type {II}. This review aims to increase our knowledge and provide an overview of the biological and methodological variations of relevance for field measurements of salivary cortisol. It is concluded that: (i) time of sampling has to be carefully registered and included in the statistical analysis; (ii) samples have to be collected at the same time of year in longitudinal designs; (iii) food intake has to be avoided in at least the 2 h before sampling; (iv) vigorous exercise has to be avoided in at least the 2 h, preferably longer, before saliva is collected for measurement of cortisol; (v) variation in results obtained by different laboratory techniques emphasizes use of the same, or otherwise made comparable, laboratory techniques; (vi) concentration of cortisol is dependent on the material of the tampon; (vii) despite the absence of hard evidence, it is recommended that information be collected and results possibly statistically controlled for alcohol consumption, medication, such as oral contraceptives, and treatment for mental diseases; (viii) saliva samples can be stored at −20°C for at least 1 year; (ix) cross‐comparisons of absolute concentrations across studies might be difficult and therefore the establishment of reference intervals for the population studied and method used is recommended.},

	abstract = {Use of technology often has unpleasant side effects, which may include strong, negative emotional states that arise during interaction with computers. Frustration, confusion, anger, anxiety and similar emotional states can affect not only the interaction itself, but also productivity, learning, social relationships, and overall well-being. This paper suggests a new solution to this problem: designing human–computer interaction systems to actively support users in their ability to manage and recover from negative emotional states. An interactive affect–support agent was designed and built to test the proposed solution in a situation where users were feeling frustration. The agent, which used only text and buttons in a graphical user interface for its interaction, demonstrated components of active listening, empathy, and sympathy in an effort to support users in their ability to recover from frustration. The agent's effectiveness was evaluated against two control conditions, which were also text-based interactions: (1) users’ emotions were ignored, and (2) users were able to report problems and ‘vent’ their feelings and concerns to the computer. Behavioral results showed that users chose to continue to interact with the system that had caused their frustration significantly longer after interacting with the affect–support agent, in comparison with the two controls. These results support the prediction that the computer can undo some of the negative feelings it causes by helping a user manage his or her emotional state.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: The serotonin transporter gene (5-{HTT}) has been proposed as a candidate gene for major depressive disorder ({MDD}). Association studies, however, have revealed inconsistent results. This could be because of the phenotypic heterogeneity of {MDD}, as it often presents with comorbid disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder ({GAD}), alcohol-related disorders, and dysthymia. {METHODS}: In this exploratory study, we performed regression analyses with generalized estimating equations in patients with familial {MDD} (n=233) in order to explore whether a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (5-{HTTLPR}) is differentially associated with {MDD} and a comorbid disorder compared with {MDD} without that particular comorbidity. As in general, {GAD} is more common in females and alcohol-related disorders are more common in males, the analyses were stratified for sex. {RESULTS}: Comorbid dysthymia was less common in s-allele carriers with {MDD} (P{\textless}0.05) than in patients homozygous for the long allele. In the sex-specific analyses, an association between the 5-{HTTLPR} and comorbid alcohol use disorders was observed in females, with s-carriers reporting significantly less alcohol use disorders. The relationship with comorbid {GAD} differed by sex with male s-carriers reporting more comorbid {GAD} than female s-carriers. {CONCLUSION}: The effect of the 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphism on {MDD} is co-dependent on the presence of comorbid disorders and sex. In this study, the s-allele of the 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphism was associated with significantly lower rates of particular lifetime comorbid disorders. Therefore, the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders should be taken into account to clarify the association of the 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphism with {MDD} phenotypes.},

	abstract = {The potential role of the serotoninergic system in the development of autistic disorder has long been suggested based on the observation of hyperserotoninemia in autistic subjects and the results of drug treatment studies. Promoter region polymorphisms (5-{HTTLPR}) of the serotonin transporter gene ({SLC}6A4) and the 5-{HT}2A receptor gene ({HTR}2A) have been studied as potential candidate genes in autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}). The objective of this family-based linkage/association study is to evaluate the relationship between {ASD} and 5-{HTTLPR} as well as that between some {SNPs} of {HTR}2A and {ASD} in Korean trios by using the transmission disequilibrium test ({TDT}). Genotyping was performed for 5-{HTTLPR} and two single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) (-1438G/A and 102T/C) of {HTR}2A. The {TDT}, linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) analysis and haplotype analysis were performed. This study comprised 126 complete trios of {ASD} patients and both parents. With regard to the transmission of 5-{HTTLPR}, the long allelic variant was preferentially transmitted in the {ASD} subjects. Based on the {TDT} results, there was no significant difference in the transmission of the two {SNPs} of {HTR}2A. However, in the results of the haplotype analysis, the {AT} haplotype demonstrated significant evidence of association with autism. The global [chi]2 test for haplotype transmission revealed a significant association between {HTR}2A and autism. Although we identified a significant association between {ASD} and 5-{HTTLPR} as well as between {ASD} and {HTR}2A, it cannot exclude the chance finding because of the low level of statistical significance and relatively small power. We believe that further studies are required to examine the relationship between serotonin-related genes and the behavioral phenotypes of {ASD} in the Korean population.},

Moreover, this work has not examined adolescents who may frequently witness and empathize with others that experience negative social experiences such as peer rejection. Here, we examined neural activity among early adolescents observing social exclusion compared to observing inclusion, and how this activity related to both trait empathy and subsequent prosocial behavior. Participants were scanned while they observed an individual whom they believed was being socially excluded. At least one day prior to the scan they reported their trait empathy, and following the scan they wrote emails to the excluded victim that were rated for prosocial behavior (e.g., helping, comforting). Observing exclusion compared to inclusion activated regions involved in mentalizing (i.e., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex), particularly among highly empathic individuals. Additionally, individuals who displayed more activity in affective, pain-related regions during observed exclusion compared to inclusion subsequently wrote more prosocial emails to excluded victims. Overall findings suggest that when early adolescents witness social exclusion in their daily lives, some may actually ‘feel the pain’ of the victims and act more prosocially toward them as a result.},

The present results indicate that in comparison to the homozygotes for the long (l) version of 5-{HTTLPR}, the carriers of the short (s) version display enhanced observational {FC}, reduced financial risk taking and increased susceptibility to framing in economic decision making. We also found that s-carriers have increased trait anxiety due to threat in social evaluation, and ambiguous threat perception. In addition, s-carriers also show reduced autonomic control over the heart, and a pattern of reduced vagal tone and increased sympathetic activity in comparison to l-homozygotes. This is the first genetic study that identifies the association of a functional polymorphism in a key neurotransmitter-related gene with complex social–emotional and cognitive processes. The present set of results suggests an endophenotype of anxiety disorders, characterized by enhanced social learning of fear, impaired decision making and dysfunctional autonomic activity.},

To put individual development in context, it is necessary to understand the nature of development amongst the normal population. Age-related centiles can be used to add this context. The level of emotion recognition is assessed using an ordinal outcome scale, and hence establishing age-related centiles for these measures creates particular analytical problems. In this paper, we use methodology previously developed by us for monitoring the development of visual acuity during childhood to calculate age-related centiles for emotion recognition ratings. The ratings do not consistently improve with age and appear to be affected by hormonal developments. A comparison of ability to rate emotions according to the stage of pubertal development is used to illustrate how the conversion of ordinal assessments to continuous centile scores facilitates the investigation. The specific issues relating to the application of the methodology to data that are not consistent in the direction of change with age and where large amounts of data can be gathered electronically are discussed.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence links chronically elevated glucocorticoid levels and cognitive impairments in a subpopulation of aged rodents and humans. Antidepressant drugs improve hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis feedback regulation and reduce plasma glucocorticoid levels. Decreasing the cumulative lifetime exposure to glucocorticoid excess by long-term exposure to antidepressants may prevent the emergence of cognitive impairments in aged rats. To test this hypothesis, we treated middle-aged male Lister hooded rats (16 months) with amitriptyline until they were 24 months of age, and their cognitive function was assessed in the water maze. Performance in the spatial learning task declined significantly with aging (p {\textless} 0.01), with 33\% of aged controls showing poorer ({\textless}2.5 {SD}) probe test performance than young controls. Amitriptyline treatment from midlife preserved water maze performance with aging (p {\textless} 0.01 compared with aged controls) and significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) reduced the proportion of poor performers (7\%). Measures of anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus-maze were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) decreased in the aged rats after amitriptyline. Furthermore, evening plasma corticosterone levels were reduced (30\% decrease; p {\textless} 0.01 compared with aged controls) after 6 months of amitriptyline. These data suggest that long-term treatment with amitriptyline decreases the prevalence of cognitive impairment in aged rats and that this may, in part, be a consequence of reduced plasma corticosterone levels and reduced anxiety.},

In these studies, one- and two-factor structures are found to be not only the most parsimonious but also the most easily replicated across variable selection procedures, and across languages and cultures. Structures with more factors are likely to show a comparative predictive advantage, but replicate more unevenly. Lexical studies appear to support a six-factor model at least as well as the Big Five. Future research attention should be directed toward inclusion of a wider range of individual differences, integration with models of temperament, and the search for causal factors and underlying mechanisms that are associated with the best-replicated personality dimensions.},

The principal concern regards the issue of non-independence, in which an initial statistical test is followed by further non-independent statistical tests. In this report, we propose a simple, practical solution to reduce bias in secondary tests due to nonindependence using a leave-one-subject-out ({LOSO}) approach. We provide examples of this method, show how it reduces effect size inflation, and suggest that it can serve as a functional localizer when within-subject methods are impractical.},

Despite significant advantages, second-order latent growth curve models ({SGMs}), which use multiple indicators, are rarely used in practice, and not all aspects of these models are widely understood. In this article, our goal is to contribute to a better understanding of theoretical and practical differences between {FGMs} and {SGMs}. We define the latent variables in {FGMs} and {SGMs} explicitly on the basis of latent state–trait ({LST}) theory and discuss insights that arise from this approach. We show that {FGMs} imply a strict trait-like conception of the construct under study, whereas {SGMs} allow for both trait and state components. Based on a simulation study and empirical applications to the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (Radloff, 1977) we illustrate that, as an important practical consequence, {FGMs} yield biased reliability estimates whenever constructs contain state components, whereas reliability estimates based on {SGMs} were found to be accurate. Implications of the state–trait distinction for the measurement of change via latent growth curve models are discussed.},

At the same time, neuroscientists, primatologists, and evolutionary biologists have begun to identify the evolutionary and neurological roots of prosocial feelings and actions. Research shows that human beings have an innate capacity for prosocial behavior, but the inclinations underlying such behavior can be inhibited or overpowered in selfish, neurotic, or culturally engrained attitudes and values. Genes, personality, past social experiences, social and cultural identities, and contextual factors can all influence the degree to which human behavior is empathic and generous or cruel, vindictive, and destructive. Prosocial Motives, Emotions, and Behavior, with a subtitle borrowed from an inaugural address In Abraham Lincoln, is a comprehensive examination of the interplay of these influences. Part I considers theoretical perspectives on prosocial behavior; Part {II} illuminates the psychological processes that underlie prosocial behavior; Part {III} focuses on specific emotions such as compassionate love, gratitude, and forgiveness; Part {IV} examines prosocial behavior between individuals at the dyadic level; and Part V investigates prosocial behavior at the societal level, with an emphasis on solving intractable conflicts and achieving desirable social change. This stimulating, wide-ranging volume is sure to be of great interest to psychologists, social scientists, and anyone with an interest in understanding and fostering prosocial behavior.},

	abstract = {Background
Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that chronic cocaine use is associated with frontal lobe abnormalities. Functional connectivity ({FC}) alterations of cocaine-dependent individuals ({CD}), however, are not yet clear. This is the first study to our knowledge that examines resting {FC} of anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) in {CD}. Because {ACC} is known to integrate inputs from different brain regions to regulate behavior, we hypothesized that {CD} will have connectivity abnormalities in {ACC} networks. In addition, we hypothesized that abnormalities would be associated with poor performance in delayed discounting and reversal learning tasks.
Methods
Resting functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected to look for {FC} differences between 27 {CD} (5 women, age: M = 39.73, {SD} = 6.14 years) and 24 control subjects (5 women, age: M = 39.76, {SD} = 7.09 years). Participants were assessed with delayed discounting and reversal learning tasks. With seed-based {FC} measures, we examined {FC} in {CD} and control subjects within five {ACC} connectivity networks with seeds in subgenual, caudal, dorsal, rostral, and perigenual {ACC}.
Results
The {CD} showed increased {FC} within the perigenual {ACC} network in left middle frontal gyrus, {ACC}, and middle temporal gyrus when compared with control subjects. The {FC} abnormalities were significantly positively correlated with task performance in delayed discounting and reversal learning tasks in {CD}.
Conclusions
The present study shows that participants with chronic cocaine-dependency have hyperconnectivity within an {ACC} network known to be involved in social processing and “mentalizing.” In addition, {FC} abnormalities found in {CD} were associated with difficulties with delay rewards and slower adaptive learning.},

We suggest instead that conscious experience should be viewed as a constructive, dynamical process that involves representational redescription: The brain continuously and unconsciously performs signal detection on its own representations, so developing an understanding of itself that subtends conscious experience. Cases where phenomenality seems to overflow access are thus illusory and depend on interactions between task instructions and stimulus complexity. We support this perspective through recent evidence suggesting that properly graded, qualitative subjective reports appear to be exhaustive in revealing conscious knowledge.},

If a similar mechanism applies to the sight of touch, movies depicting touch should automatically activate the somatosensory cortex of the observer. Here we found using {fMRI} that the secondary but not the primary somatosensory cortex is activated both when the participants were touched and when they observed someone or something else getting touched by objects. The neural mechanisms enabling our own sensation of touch may therefore be a window also to our understanding of touch.},

Although recognizing that no natural science can serve as an automatic template for our work, we suggest that Darwin's work on evolution provides a far more applicable model for linking theory and research since he dealt with obstacles far more similar to our own. This includes drawing rigorous conclusions based on observational data rather than true experiments; an ability to absorb enormous amounts of diverse data into a relatively simple system that did not include a large number of what we think of as independent variables; the absence of prediction as a standard for evaluating the adequacy of a theory; and the ability to use a theory that is incomplete in both the evidence that supports it and in its development.

	issn = {1046-9516},
	abstract = {Many readers of this monograph may wonder why a chapter on statistical power was included. After all, by now the issue of statistical power is in many respects mundane. Everyone knows that statistical power is a central research consideration, and certainly most National Institute on Drug Abuse grantees or prospective grantees understand the importance of including a power analysis in research proposals. However, there is ample evidence that, in practice, prevention researchers are not paying sufficient attention to statistical power. If they were, the findings observed by Hansen (1992) in a recent review of the prevention literature would not have emerged. Hansen (1992) examined statistical power based on 46 cohorts followed longitudinally, using nonparametric assumptions given the subjects' age at posttest and the numbers of subjects. Results of this analysis indicated that, in order for a study to attain 80-percent power for detecting differences between treatment and control groups, the difference between groups at posttest would need to be at least 8 percent (in the best studies) and as much as 16 percent (in the weakest studies). In order for a study to attain 80-percent power for detecting group differences in pre-post change, 22 of the 46 cohorts would have needed relative pre-post reductions of greater than 100 percent. Thirty-three of the 46 cohorts had less than 50-percent power to detect a 50-percent relative reduction in substance use. These results are consistent with other review findings (e.g., Lipsey 1990) that have shown a similar lack of power in a broad range of research topics. Thus, it seems that, although researchers are aware of the importance of statistical power (particularly of the necessity for calculating it when proposing research), they somehow are failing to end up with adequate power in their completed studies. This chapter argues that the failure of many prevention studies to maintain adequate statistical power is due to an overemphasis on sample size (N) as the only, or even the best, way to increase statistical power. It is easy to see how this overemphasis has come about. Sample size is easy to manipulate, has the advantage of being related to power in a straight-forward way, and usually is under the direct control of the researcher, except for limitations imposed by finances or subject availability. Another option for increasing power is to increase the alpha used for hypothesis-testing but, as very few researchers seriously consider significance levels much larger than the traditional .05, this strategy seldom is used. Of course, sample size is important, and the authors of this chapter are not recommending that researchers cease choosing sample sizes carefully. Rather, they argue that researchers should not confine themselves to increasing N to enhance power. It is important to take additional measures to maintain and improve power over and above making sure the initial sample size is sufficient. The authors recommend two general strategies. One strategy involves attempting to maintain the effective initial sample size so that power is not lost needlessly. The other strategy is to take measures to maximize the third factor that determines statistical power: effect size.},

Methods: Forty-three medication-free, treatment-resistant, predominantly rapid-cycling bipolar disorder patients and 43 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects had cerebral glucose metabolism assessed using positron emission tomography and fluorine-18-deoxyglucose.
Results: Depressed bipolar disorder patients compared to control subjects had decreased global, absolute prefrontal and anterior paralimbic cortical, and increased normalized subcortical (ventral striatum, thalamus, right amygdala) metabolism. Degree of depression correlated negatively with absolute prefrontal and paralimbic cortical, and positively with normalized anterior paralimbic subcortical metabolism. Increased normalized cerebello-posterior cortical metabolism was seen in all patient subgroups compared to control subjects, independent of mood state, disorder subtype, or cycle frequency.
Conclusions: In bipolar depression, we observed a pattern of prefrontal hypometabolism, consistent with observations in primary unipolar and secondary depression, suggesting this is part of a common neural substrate for depression independent of etiology. In contrast, the cerebello-posterior cortical normalized hypermetabolism seen in all bipolar subgroups (including euthymic) suggests a possible congenital or acquired trait abnormality. The degree to which these findings in treatment-resistant, predominantly rapid-cycling patients pertain to community samples remains to be established.},

Somatic symptoms and medical visits were unchanged as a result of the intervention. However, significant Time × Condition effects indicated that optimism scores increased, negative-affect scores decreased, and positive-affect words in student essays increased in the experimental condition. Expressive writing shows promise as a cost-efficient intervention to address the emotional concerns of young adolescents; further work with clinical populations may lead to even more robust results.},

In particular, the {SERTPR} insertion/deletion polymorphism has been related to hippocampal volume and amygdala response and it has been found to influence anxiety-related personality traits and anxiety disorders; in mood disorders it showed some influences on age at onset, periodicity, illness recurrence, rapid cycling, antidepressants response and depressive reaction to stressful life events. Psychosomatic disorders, suicide, alcoholism, smoking, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders and autism have been also found to be related to {SERTPR} variants. {SERT} gene variants seem therefore to modulate a wide range of aspects in both normal and affected individuals, many of which are possibly due to indirect correlations between such human features.},

We provide evidence from two naturalistic studies that, using different methods, showed that the emotional fluctuations of individuals who exhibited low self-esteem (Study 1) and depression (Study 2) were characterized by higher levels of inertia in both positive and negative emotions than the emotional fluctuations of people who did not exhibit low self-esteem and depression.

We adopt an interdependence theoretical approach to the novel concept of social mindfulness, which we conceptualize in terms of other-regarding choices involving both skill (to see it, e.g., theory of mind, perspective taking) and will (to do it, e.g., empathic concern, prosocial orientation) to act mindfully toward another person’s control over outcomes. We operationalized social mindfulness in a new social decision-making paradigm that focuses on leaving or limiting choice options for others that we tested across 7 studies. Studies 1a through 1c showed that people with other-oriented mindsets left interdependent others more choice than people with self-oriented and/or unspecified mindsets. Studies 2a and 2b revealed that people developed more favorable judgments of a socially mindful than of a socially unmindful person. Study 3 revealed that unknown others with trustworthy (vs. untrustworthy) faces were met with more social mindfulness. Study 4 revealed that social mindfulness could be traced in personality by being positively related to Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness ({HEXACO} Personality Inventory-Revised) as well as to Empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index) and a prosocial value orientation ({SVO}). Together, these studies contribute to explaining how social mindfulness can help people to navigate the social world by aiming to maximize other people’s control over their situational outcomes.},

We assessed this inability using alexithymia and empathy questionnaires, and used {fMRI} to investigate brain activity while introspecting on emotion. Individuals with high functioning autism/Asperger syndrome ({HFA}/{AS}) were compared with matched controls. Participants rated stimuli from the International Affective Picture System twice, once according to the degree of un/pleasantness that the pictures induced, and once according to their color balance. The groups differed significantly on both alexithymia and empathy questionnaires. Alexithymia and lack of empathy were correlated, indicating a link between understanding one's own and others’ emotions. For both groups a strong relationship between questionnaire scores and brain activity was found in the anterior insula ({AI}), when participants were required to assess their feelings to unpleasant pictures. Regardless of self-reported degree of emotional awareness, individuals with {HFA}/{AS} differed from controls when required to introspect on their feelings by showing reduced activation in self-reflection/mentalizing regions. Thus, we conclude that difficulties in emotional awareness are related to hypoactivity in {AI} in both individuals with {HFA}/{AS} and controls, and that the particular difficulties in emotional awareness in individuals with {HFA}/{AS} are not related to their impairments in self-reflection/mentalizing.},

	abstract = {A traveler visiting Rio, Manila or Caracas does not need a report to learn that these cities are unequal; she can see it directly from the taxicab window. This is because in most cities inequality is conspicuous, but also, because cities express different forms of inequality that are evident to casual observers. Cities are highly heterogeneous and often unequal with respect to the income of their residents, but also with respect to the cleanliness of their neighborhoods, the beauty of their architecture, and the liveliness of their streets, among many other evaluative dimensions. Until now, however, our ability to understand the effect of a city's built environment on social and economic outcomes has been limited by the lack of quantitative data on urban perception. Here, we build on the intuition that inequality is partly conspicuous to create quantitative measure of a city's contrasts. Using thousands of geo-tagged images, we measure the perception of safety, class and uniqueness; in the cities of Boston and New York in the United States, and Linz and Salzburg in Austria, finding that the range of perceptions elicited by the images of New York and Boston is larger than the range of perceptions elicited by images from Linz and Salzburg. We interpret this as evidence that the cityscapes of Boston and New York are more contrasting, or unequal, than those of Linz and Salzburg. Finally, we validate our measures by exploring the connection between them and homicides, finding a significant correlation between the perceptions of safety and class and the number of homicides in a {NYC} zip code, after controlling for the effects of income, population, area and age. Our results show that online images can be used to create reproducible quantitative measures of urban perception and characterize the inequality of different cities.},

The authors argue that it is impossible to resolve such debates unless researchers focus on patterns of stability and the developmental mechanisms that may give rise to them. To facilitate this shift in emphasis, they describe a formal model that integrates 3 developmental processes: stochastic-contextual processes, person-environment transactions, and developmental constancies. The theoretical and mathematical analyses indicate that this model makes novel predictions about the way in which test-retest correlations are structured across a wide range of ages and test-retest intervals. The authors illustrate the utility of the model by comparing its predictions against meta-analytic data on Neuroticism. The discussion emphasizes the value of focusing on patterns of continuity, not only as phenomena to be explained but as data capable of clarifying the developmental processes underlying stability and change for a variety of psychological constructs.},

In monkeys and humans, the {STS} region is activated by movements of the eyes, mouth, hands and body, suggesting that it is involved in analysis of biological motion. However, it is also activated by static images of the face and body, suggesting that it is sensitive to implied motion and more generally to stimuli that signal the actions of another individual. Subsequent analysis of socially relevant stimuli is carried out in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, which supports a three-structure model proposed by Brothers. The homology of human and monkey areas involved in social perception, and the functional interrelationships between the {STS} region and the ventral face area, are unresolved issues.},

Yet in everyday life, hand actions are also modulated by our affective state, revealing it, in turn, to the observer. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to identify brain regions engaged during the observation of hand actions performed either in a neutral or an angry way. We also asked whether these are the same regions as those involved in perceiving expressive faces. During the passive observation of emotionally neutral hand movements, the {fMRI} signal increased significantly in dorsal and ventral premotor cortices, with the exact location of the ‘peaks’ distinct from those induced by face observation. Various areas in the extrastriate visual cortex were also engaged, overlapping with the face-related activity. When the observed hand action was performed with emotion, additional regions were recruited including the right dorsal premotor, the right medial prefrontal cortex, the left anterior insula and a region in the rostral part of the supramarginal gyrus bilaterally. These regions, except for the supramarginal gyrus, were also activated during the perception of angry faces. These results complement the wealth of studies on the perception of affect from faces and provide further insights into the processes involved in the perception of others underlying, perhaps, social constructs such as empathy.},

To our knowledge, no study has demonstrated changes in personality in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event. Intriguingly, double-blind controlled studies have shown that the classic hallucinogen psilocybin occasions personally and spiritually significant mystical experiences that predict long-term changes in behaviors, attitudes and values. In the present report we assessed the effect of psilocybin on changes in the five broad domains of personality – Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Consistent with participant claims of hallucinogen-occasioned increases in aesthetic appreciation, imagination, and creativity, we found significant increases in Openness following a high-dose psilocybin session. In participants who had mystical experiences during their psilocybin session, Openness remained significantly higher than baseline more than 1 year after the session. The findings suggest a specific role for psilocybin and mystical-type experiences in adult personality change.},

Neurophysiological studies of perceptual suppression show recurrent processing in visual cortex for consciously invisible objects.

Adolescents regularly experience peer rejection firsthand and witness these behaviors among their peers. In the current study, neuroimaging techniques were employed to conduct a preliminary investigation of the affective and cognitive processes involved in witnessing peer acceptance and rejection – specifically when these witnessed events occur in the immediate aftermath of a firsthand experience with rejection. During an {fMRI} scan, 23 adolescents underwent a simulated experience of firsthand peer rejection. Then, immediately following this experience they watched as another adolescent was ostensibly first accepted and then rejected. Findings indicated that in the immediate aftermath of being rejected by peers, adolescents displayed neural activity consistent with distress when they saw another peer being accepted, and neural activity consistent with emotion regulation and mentalizing (e.g. perspective-taking) processes when they saw another peer being rejected. Furthermore, individuals displaying a heightened sensitivity to firsthand rejection were more likely to show neural activity consistent with distress when observing a peer being accepted. Findings are discussed in terms of how witnessing others being accepted or rejected relates to adolescents' interpretations of both firsthand and observed experiences with peers. In addition, the potential impact that witnessed events might have on the broader perpetuation of bullying at this age is also considered.},

Participants were part of the Primary Care Anxiety Project ({PCAP}), a naturalistic, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders in primary care. Participants completed an intake evaluation and follow-up assessments at 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter. Only participants with sleep data at intake were included in the current study (n = 533). The majority (74\%) reported experiencing sleep disturbance at intake. Those with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder ({GAD}) or post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) were over 2 times more likely to have sleep problems. Sleep disturbance at intake did not relate to the longitudinal course of {GAD}, social phobia, panic disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, it did predict the course of {PTSD}, controlling for comorbid major depressive disorder ({MDD}) and having more than one anxiety disorder diagnosis intake, those with sleep disturbance at intake being less likely to remit from {PTSD} in the 5 years of follow-up. By year 5, only 34\% of those with sleep problems at intake remitted from {PTSD} whereas 56\% of those without sleep disturbance remitted from the disorder. The findings suggest that sleep disturbance in {PTSD} may have prognostic significance and may be important to address in clinical interventions.},

	abstract = {It is well established that the maximal therapeutic effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRI}) are achieved in depressive patients after several weeks of treatment, but the adaptive processes leading to the therapeutic effects are unclear. It has been shown that hyperactivity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) axis in depressive patients is affected by long-term antidepressant treatment. These changes occur in association with the mood normalising effect, suggesting that antidepressants affect the {HPA} axis and this effect is associated with the therapeutic effect. Male Wistar rats were treated with the {SSRI}, citalopram, to investigate time-related changes in components that may be involved in the desensitization of the {HPA} axis. A single injection of citalopram (10 mg/kg, s.c.), increased the plasma levels of {ACTH} and corticosterone in a dose-dependent manner and increased the number of c-Fos containing cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. A daily treatment with the same compound (10 mg/kg, s.c.) for 14 days decreased the expression of {POMC} {mRNA} ( approximately 40\%). In addition, a blunted response to citalopram was observed in animals long-term treated with citalopram. Also {CRF}-stimulated {cAMP} accumulation in the pituitary was altered. In conclusion, acute citalopram activated the {HPA}-axis at the hypothalamic level and long-term citalopram treatment desensitized the {HPA}-axis at the pituitary level. These results support the hypothesis that the therapeutic effects of long-term antidepressant treatments reduce {HPA} axis responsiveness.},

We tested the hypothesis that the hypothalamusâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal ({HPA}) system-dampening effects of venlafaxine and mirtazapine differ. We compared the course of morning (08.00\&\#xa0;h) and afternoon saliva cortisol (16.00\&\#xa0;h) in 42 mirtazapine- and 45 venlafaxine-treated depressed patients during a 1-week wash-out and a 4-week treatment period in a randomised open trial. Mirtazapine lowered afternoon cortisol from week 1 to 4. In contrast, during the course of the entire treatment period, venlafaxine did not attenuate saliva cortisol concentrations. Treatment effects of mirtazapine on cortisol concentrations did not differ in remitters and non-remitters to treatment. High baseline cortisol concentrations, on the other hand, were related to an unfavourable course during venlafaxine treatment and patients remitting during venlafaxine treatment had significantly lower afternoon cortisol concentrations in saliva, when compared to non-remitting patients. Thus, mirtazapine and venlafaxine show different effects on {HPA} system activity as measured by saliva cortisol. This may be of relevance with regard to physical sequelae of depression.},

	abstract = {Objective
Outcome and family history data differentiate children with severe mood dysregulation ({SMD}), a syndrome characterized by chronic irritability, from children with “classic” episodic bipolar disorder ({BD}). Nevertheless, the presence of cognitive inflexibility in {SMD} and {BD} highlights the need to delineate neurophysiologic similarities and differences between the two patient groups. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine neural correlates of cognitive flexibility deficits in patients with {SMD} and {BD} versus healthy volunteers ({HV}).
Method
During functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects completed a response reversal task that assessed cognitive flexibility (n = 22 with {SMD}, 26 with {BD}, 34 {HV}). Task effects were examined in four regions of interest: caudate, cingulate gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}), and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
Results
Diagnosis-by-accuracy interactions emerged in the caudate and {IFG}. In these regions, the difference in activation was calculated between incorrect and correct trials. In the caudate, this value was smaller in subjects with {SMD} and with {BD} than in {HV}. In the {IFG}, however, this value was smaller in subjects with {SMD} than in those with {BD} and in {HV}. Post hoc analyses indicated that comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in patients may influence the caudate findings. Exploratory whole-brain analysis confirmed the caudate and {IFG} findings. In addition, other regions differentiating {SMD} from {BD} were identified (e.g., superior parietal lobule/precuneus and inferior temporal gyrus).
Conclusions
In response to errors, similar perturbations occur in the caudate for youth with {SMD} and {BD} compared with {HV} youth. {IFG} deficits, in contrast, manifest in youth with {SMD}, but not with {BD}.},

In this essay, I show how both of these lines have been shaped by an older debate between two 19th century narratives about modernity: one celebrating the liberation of individuals, the other mourning the loss of community and moral authority. I suggest that both lines of moral psychology have limited themselves to the moral domain prescribed by the liberation narrative, and so one future step for moral psychology should be to study alternative moral perspectives, particularly religious and politically conservative ones in which morality is, in part, about protecting groups, institutions, and souls.},

	abstract = {Background

Psychopathic traits are associated with increases in antisocial behaviors such as aggression and are characterized by reduced empathy for others' distress. This suggests that psychopathic traits may also impair empathic pain sensitivity. However, whether psychopathic traits affect responses to the pain of others versus the self has not been previously assessed.


Method

We used whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activation in 14 adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder and psychopathic traits, as well as 21 healthy controls matched on age, gender, and intelligence. Activation in structures associated with empathic pain perception was assessed as adolescents viewed photographs of pain-inducing injuries. Adolescents imagined either that the body in each photograph was their own or that it belonged to another person. Behavioral and neuroimaging data were analyzed using random-effects analysis of variance.


Results

Youths with psychopathic traits showed reduced activity within regions associated with empathic pain as the depicted pain increased. These regions included rostral anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum (putamen), and amygdala. Reductions in amygdala activity particularly occurred when the injury was perceived as occurring to another. Empathic pain responses within both amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with the severity of psychopathic traits as indexed by {PCL}:{YV} scores.


Conclusions

Youths with psychopathic traits show less responsiveness in regions implicated in the affective response to another's pain as the perceived intensity of this pain increases. Moreover, this reduced responsiveness appears to predict symptom severity.},

To organise emerging findings, we present a dual-process framework that integrates explicit and implicit forms of emotion regulation, and argue that both forms of regulation are necessary for well-being. In the first section of this review, we provide a broad overview of the construct of emotion regulation, with an emphasis on explicit and implicit processes. In the second section, we focus on explicit emotion regulation, considering both neural mechanisms that are associated with these processes and their experiential and physiological consequences. In the third section, we turn to several forms of implicit emotion regulation, and integrate the burgeoning literature in this area. We conclude by outlining open questions and areas for future research.},

Multinomial logit regression was used to examine the incidence of multiple idiopathic physical symptoms, resolution of such symptoms, and related mortality among individuals in the general population, with adjustment for demographic characteristics and the presence or absence at baseline of a lifetime diagnosis of major depression, dysthymia, anxiety disorder, and alcohol abuse. Multinomial logit modeling also accounts for the impact of competing outcomes, such as survey nonresponse. {RESULTS}: Most of the individuals with multiple idiopathic physical symptoms recovered over the ensuing year. The incidence of multiple idiopathic physical symptoms among those without such symptoms at baseline was 1.7\%. The predicted mortality among individuals with multiple idiopathic physical symptoms at baseline was higher than for individuals not having such symptoms at baseline (0.28\% versus 0.18\%). The higher mortality rate among those with multiple idiopathic physical symptoms at baseline persisted after adjustment for covariates and competing outcomes. {CONCLUSIONS}: Outcomes associated with multiple idiopathic physical symptoms vary widely. Most individuals improve over time. However, the course for a few individuals is less benign than perhaps previously thought. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms behind increases in mortality related to multiple idiopathic physical symptoms, the predictors of poor prognosis, and whether mortality remains elevated over longer periods of follow-up.},

To examine behavioral interventions for sleep problems in children with autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}).


{METHODS}

A systematic review evaluating all published studies examining the effectiveness of behavioral treatment of sleep problems in children with {ASD} is presented.


{RESULTS}

Based on the Chambless criteria for treatment efficacy, both standard extinction and scheduled awakenings met criteria for possibly efficacious interventions for sleep problems in children with {ASD}. Some positive outcomes have been reported, but there has not been enough research examining graduated extinction, faded bedtime, stimulus fading and chronotherapy to make any firm conclusions regarding treatment efficacy for children with {ASD}.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Although more rigorous research is required in order for any sleep interventions for children with {ASD} to be considered probably efficacious or well-established, the current literature should be used to guide clinical decisions and direct research questions.},

Study 2 ruled out differences in welfare sensitivity as an explanation for these findings. In Study 3, religiosity and political conservatism predicted a commitment to judging “harmless” taboo violations morally impermissible, rather than discretionary, despite the lack of negative consequences rising from the act. Furthermore, non-consequentialist thinking style was shown to mediate the relationship religiosity/conservatism had with impermissibility judgments, while intuitive thinking style did not. These data provide further evidence for the influence of religious and political commitments in motivating divergent moral judgments, while highlighting a new dispositional factor, non-consequentialist thinking style, as a mediator of these effects.},

Recall was high for behaviors that were incongruent with a personality-trait impression for a character, whereas recall was much lower for behaviors that were congruent or neutral with reference to the impression. Set size, the number of congruent and incongruent behaviors attributed to the character, was shown to be a major determinant of this result. The smaller the size of the incongruent set, the higher the probability of recalling an item from the set. There was no tendency for behaviors to cluster by trait category in recall output protocols. This result is interpreted as evidence that a simple analogy to hierarchical noun categories, studied in many verbal learning experiments on organization of memory, did not apply to the present results. Three theoretical analyses—an associative network model, a depth-of-processing model, and a schema model—are reviewed in light of these results. (56 ref)},

	abstract = {The midfrontal cortex, and particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus, appears active in many studies of functional imaging. Various models have competed to explain the functions of the anterior cingulate in relation to its patterns of activation. We believe that the concept of self-regulation is valuable in considering the role of the cingulate. The sensitivity of the cingulate to both reward and pain, and evidence for cingulate coupling to cognitive and emotional areas during task performance, support this identification. Self-regulation is a very broad concept that does not lend itself very well to specific models or tests, but it does provide a framework for examining development. We trace the role of the midfrontal cortex in evolution and infant development. Both genes and environment influence self-regulation. The presence of both genetic and environmental effects raises the issue of their interaction, which we discuss in relation to the dopamine 4 receptor gene and parenting methods. The role of the midfrontal cortex in self-regulation allows us to consider both brain networks common to all people and network efficiency underlying individual differences in behavior.

Rapid two-choice decisions yield multiple empirical measures: response times for correct and error responses, the probabilities of correct and error responses, and a variety of interactions between accuracy and response time that depend on instructions and task difficulty. The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do. Variability within the decision process explains how errors are made, and variability across trials correctly predicts when errors are faster than correct responses and when they are slower.},

We hypothesized that participants with more adaptive personality functioning during childhood would be more likely to volunteer during adolescence and that membership in social organizations would mediate the relation of personality to volunteering during adolescence. Participants from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}) with complete data measures for the four time periods of study were categorized into one of three personality types during early childhood. Children assigned to the resilient personality type were more likely than children characterized by the overcontrolled and undercontrolled personality types to volunteer 8 and 10 years later in adolescence. Analyses demonstrated that the association of childhood personality to adolescent volunteering is not mediated by late-childhood membership in social institutions that may facilitate entry into volunteering. The findings are interpreted in terms of their implications for understanding personality and prosocial behavior.},

However, so far, no study examined the individual association between cortisol response and cerebral in vivo 5-{HTT} levels in patients suffering from negative mood states. {OBJECTIVE}: The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the interrelation of cortisol response, thalamic 5-{HTT} levels, and anxiety in healthy subjects and two previously published samples of patients with unipolar major depression ({UMD}) and obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}), controlling for age, gender, 5-{HTT} genotype, smoking, and seasonality. {METHODS}: Regional 5-{HTT} levels and cortisol response to dexamethasone-corticotropin (Dex-{CRH}) challenge were assessed in consecutive samples of medication-free patients suffering from {UMD} (N = 10) and {OCD} (N = 10), and 20 healthy volunteers. The intervention used was combined Dex-{CRH} test and [(11)C]{DASB} positron emission tomography. The main outcome measures were: 5-{HTT} binding potential ({BP}({ND})) in a predefined thalamic {ROI}, cortisol response defined as the maximum cortisol increase in the combined Dex-{CRH}-test, and state of anxiety from the state-trait-anxiety inventory. {RESULTS}: Reduced thalamic 5-{HTT} {BP}({ND}) was associated with increased cortisol response (r = -0.35, p {\textless} 0.05; in patients: r = -0.53, p {\textless} 0.01) and with increased state anxiety (r = -0.46, p {\textless} 0.01), surviving correction for age, gender, 5-{HTT} genotype, smoking, and seasonality (p {\textless} 0.05). The 5-{HTT} genotype, on the contrary, was not significantly associated with cortisol response (p = 0.19) or negative mood (p = 0.23). {CONCLUSION}: The association between stress hormone response, thalamic 5-{HTT} levels, and anxiety in patients suffering from negative mood states suggests an interaction between two major mechanisms implicated in negative mood states in humans.},

However, most previous model-based {fMRI} studies have ignored individual differences due to the challenge of obtaining reliable parameter estimates for individual participants. Meanwhile, previous cognitive science studies have demonstrated that hierarchical Bayesian analysis is useful for obtaining reliable parameter estimates in cognitive models while allowing for individual differences. Here we demonstrate the application of hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to model-based {fMRI} using the example of decision making in the Iowa Gambling Task.

	abstract = {Recent researchers have suggested that a region of right temporo-parietal junction ({RTPJ}) selectively subserves the attribution of beliefs to other people (Saxe R, Kanwisher N. 2003. People thinking about thinking people: {fMRI} investigations of theory of mind. {NeuroImage}. 19:1835–1842; Saxe R, Powell {LJ}. 2006. It's the thought that counts: specific brain regions for one component of theory of mind. Psychol Sci. 17:692–699; Saxe R, Wexler A. 2005. Making sense of another mind: the role of the right temporo-parietal junction. Neuropsychologia. 43:1391–1399). At the same time, a similar {RTPJ} region has been observed repeatedly in a variety of nonsocial tasks that require participants to redirect attention to task-relevant stimuli (e.g., Corbetta M, Shulman {GL}. 2002. Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain. Nat Rev Neurosci. 3:201–215; Serences {JT}, Shomstein S, Leber {AB}, Golay X, Egeth {HE}, Yantis S. 2005. Coordination of voluntary and stimulus-driven attentional control in human cortex. Psychol Sci. 16:114–122). However, because these 2 sets of tasks have never been compared within the same participants, it remains unclear whether these observations refer to the exact same region of {RTPJ} or may instead involve neighboring regions with distinct functional profiles. To test the claim that there is a region of {RTPJ} selective for belief attribution, the current study used functional neuroimaging to examine the extent to which cortical loci identified by a “theory-of-mind localizer” also distinguish between trials on a target detection task that varied demands to reorient attention (i.e., a version of the “Posner cueing task”). Results were incompatible with claims of {RTPJ} selectivity for mental state attribution. Regardless of whether regions were defined from group analyses or were individually tailored for each participant, {RTPJ} activity was also modulated by the nonsocial attentional task. The overlap between theory-of-mind and attentional reorienting suggests the need for new accounts of {RTPJ} function that integrate across these disparate task comparisons.},

This view has been indirectly supported by data demonstrating similar patterns of brain activity – most importantly, in the anterior insula – during both interoception and emotion elicitation. However, no study has directly compared these two phenomena within participants, leaving it unclear whether interoception and emotional experience truly share the same functional neural architecture. The current study addressed this gap in knowledge by examining the neural convergence of these two phenomena within the same population. In one task, participants monitored their own heartbeat; in another task they watched emotional video clips and rated their own emotional responses to the videos. Consistent with prior research, heartbeat monitoring engaged a circumscribed area spanning insular cortex and adjacent inferior frontal operculum. Critically, this interoception-related cluster also was engaged when participants rated their own emotion, and activity here correlated with the trial-by-trial intensity of participants' emotional experience. These findings held across both group-level and individual participant-level approaches to localizing interoceptive cortex. Together, these data further clarify the functional role of the anterior insula and provide novel insights about the connection between bodily awareness and emotion.},

Monkey electrophysiological studies, however, have also observed prefrontal neuronal activity associated with cognitive processes that are nonmnemonic. We tested the hypothesis that the same regions of human prefrontal cortex that demonstrate activity during working memory tasks would also demonstrate activity during tasks without working memory demands. During echoplanar {fMRI} imaging, subjects performed a three-condition experiment (working memory task, nonworking memory task, rest). In the working memory task, subjects observed serially presented stimuli and determined if each stimulus was the same as that presented two stimuli back. The nonworking memory task in Experiment 1 required subjects to identify a single predetermined stimulus; in Experiment 2, subjects were required to make a button press to every stimulus. In all subjects in both experiments, the working memory task exhibited greater prefrontal cortical activity compared to either nonworking memory task. In these same prefrontal regions, greater activation was also observed during both nonworking memory tasks compared to rest. We conclude that human lateral prefrontal cortex supports processes in addition to working memory. Thus, reverse inference of the form “if prefrontal cortex is active, working memory is engaged” is not supported.},

	abstract = {The influence of social relationships on health has been well documented for many years, yet identifying the physiological mechanisms responsible for these effects has proved more challenging. This review assesses the potential role of the serotonin system in affecting sensitivity to the health-related effects of the social environment. Building on recent studies of genetic variation in the serotonin system, particularly focusing on a polymorphism (5-{HTTLPR}) in the serotonin transporter gene, we provide evidence that activity within the serotonin system is critically involved in setting sensitivity to social experiences. Furthermore, we highlight the effects of the 5-{HTTLPR} on sensitivity to both positive and negative social experiences. In a positive environment, individuals with the short allele, and particularly the short/short genotype, function better psychologically than those with the long/long genotype. Conversely, when exposed to adverse environments or in the absence of social support, individuals with the short allele are at high risk for a variety of negative health outcomes. This serotoninergic involvement in social sensitivity seems to occur in concert with other neurochemical systems, such as the opioid system, which will also be discussed. Although this differential sensitivity to social experiences is initially determined in the brain, it has physiological effects on downstream pathways that more directly affect disease mechanisms, such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is a particular focus of this review. The serotonin system, as indexed by the 5-{HTTLPR}, is an important link between the social environment and health.},

First, research grounded in normative models of {JDM} has moved beyond the study of age differences in risk perception and toward a dynamic account of the factors predicting adolescent decisions. Second, the field has seen widespread adoption of dual-process models of cognitive development that describe 2 relatively independent modes of information processing, typically contrasting an analytic (cold) system with an experiential (hot) one. Finally, there has been an increase in attention to the social, emotional, and self-regulatory factors that influence {JDM}.

Typical adolescent behaviour such as increased risk-taking and novelty-seeking is probably related to developmental changes in the brain reward system. This functional {MRI} study investigated how brain activation related to two components of reward processing (Reward Anticipation and Reward Outcome) changes with age in a sample of 39 children, adolescents and young adults aged 10–25. Our data revealed age-related changes in brain activity during both components of reward processing. Activation related to Reward Anticipation increased with age, while activation related to Reward Outcome decreased in various regions of the reward network. This shift from outcome to anticipation was confirmed by subsequent analyses showing positive correlations between age and the difference in activation between Reward Anticipation and Reward Outcome. The shift was predominantly present in striatal regions and was accompanied by a significant effect of age on behaviour, with older participants showing more response speeding on potentially rewarding trials than younger participants. This study provides evidence for functional changes in the reward system which may underlie typical adolescent behaviour.},

The embodiment of emotion, when induced in human participants by manipulations of facial expression and posture in the laboratory, causally affects how emotional information is processed. Congruence between the recipient's bodily expression of emotion and the sender's emotional tone of language, for instance, facilitates comprehension of the communication, whereas incongruence can impair comprehension.

	abstract = {Adolescence is characterized by heightened and sometimes impairing reward sensitivity, yet less is known about how adolescents recover from highly arousing positive states. This is particularly important given high onset rates of psychopathology associated with reward sensitivity during late adolescence and early adulthood. The current study thus utilized a novel reward sensitivity task in order to examine potential ways in which older adolescent females (ages 18–21; N = 83) might recover from high arousal positive reward sensitive states. Participants underwent a fixed incentive reward sensitivity task and subsequently watched a neutral, sad, or a low approach-motivated positive emotional film clip during which subjective and physiological recovery was assessed. Results indicated that the positive and negative film conditions were associated with maintained physiological arousal while the neutral condition facilitated faster physiological recovery from the reward sensitivity task. It is interesting to note that individual differences in self-reported positive emotion during the reward task were associated with faster recovery in the neutral condition. Findings suggest elicited emotion (regardless of valence) may serve to maintain reward sensitivity whereas self-reported positive emotional experience may be a key ingredient facilitating physiological recovery or undoing. Understanding the nuances of reward recovery provides a critical step in understanding the etiology and persistence of reward dysregulation more generally.},

Insula function has been associated with emotional regulation, adjusting to changing outcomes under risk, reward and loss anticipation, discounting of future rewards, and self-rated impulsivity. The role of the insula in these processes may be fundamentally related to prospective thinking, a trait that increases with age. There is evidence that insular cortical thickness shows age related decreases that parallel age related increases in future orientation and planning. We tested the hypothesis that nonplanning decreases with age and that insula thickness is related to both age and nonplanning impulsivity. Fifty-nine male and female participants, ranging in age from 10 to 22 years old, underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) procedures and were assessed using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ({BIS}). We observed that anterior insula thickness and nonplanning impulsivity show an inverse relationship with age and that there is a significant positive linear relationship between anterior insula thickness and nonplanning.},

	abstract = {Volunteering is any activity in which time is given freely to benefit another person, group or cause. Volunteering is part of a cluster of helping behaviors, entailing more commitment than spontaneous assistance but narrower in scope than the care provided to family and friends. Although developed somewhat independently, the study of volunteerism and of social activism have much in common. Since data gathering on volunteering from national samples began about a quarter of a century ago, the rate for the United States has been stable or, according to some studies, rising slightly. Theories that explain volunteering by pointing to individual attributes can be grouped into those that emphasize motives or self-understandings on the one hand and those that emphasize rational action and cost-benefit analysis on the other. Other theories seek to complement this focus on individual level factors by pointing to the role of social resources, specifically social ties and organizational activity, as explanations for volunteering. Support is found for all theories, although many issues remained unresolved. Age, gender and race differences in volunteering can be accounted for, in large part, by pointing to differences in self-understandings, human capital, and social resources. Less attention has been paid to contextual effects on volunteering and, while evidence is mixed, the impact of organizational, community, and regional characteristics on individual decisions to volunteer remains a fruitful field for exploration. Studies of the experience of volunteering have only just begun to plot and explain spells of volunteering over the life course and to examine the causes of volunteer turnover. Examining the premise that volunteering is beneficial for the helper as well as the helped, a number of studies have looked at the impact of volunteering on subjective and objective well-being. Positive effects are found for life-satisfaction, self-esteem, self-rated health, and for educational and occupational achievement, functional ability, and mortality. Studies of youth also suggest that volunteering reduces the likelihood of engaging in problem behaviors such as school truancy and drug abuse.},

The present analysis suggests that the greater propensity of adolescents to take risks is not due to age differences in risk perception or appraisal, but to age differences in psychosocial factors that influence self-regulation. It is argued that adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability to risk taking because of a disjunction between novelty and sensation seeking (both of which increase dramatically at puberty) and the development of self-regulatory competence (which does not fully mature until early adulthood). This disjunction is biologically driven, normative, and unlikely to be remedied through educational interventions designed to change adolescents' perception, appraisal, or understanding of risk. Interventions should begin from the premise that adolescents are inherently more likely than adults to take risks, and should focus on reducing the harm associated with risk-taking behavior.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that heavy alcohol use and alcohol dependence ({AD}) tend to increase in adolescence and emerging adulthood and then show a large decline in the late 20s, a phenomenon called maturing out. This decline has been explained as an effect of “role incompatibility” in which involvement in new roles and activities interferes with a heavy drinking lifestyle. However, maturing out has been conceived mostly as a decrease in offset, with little attention paid to reductions in new onset or recurrence across decades of life. Moreover, although role incompatibility processes have been studied with young samples, little is known about the effect of life transitions (e.g., marriage, parenthood, changes in employment status) on {AD} later in life and whether similar effects are observed. Using longitudinal data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative epidemiologic survey, we examined the patterns of stability and change in {AD} across the life span and the differential effect of life transitions on {AD} across different age strata. Results showed that persistence of {AD} tended to increase with age, although not dramatically, and that onset and recurrence tended to decrease with age. Moreover, the effects of life transitions on the course of {AD} varied across the life span and were different for men and women. These results indicate that life transitions differentially affect the patterns of stability and change in younger versus older people, have a different impact for men and women, and highlight the need to consider the unique aspects of each stage of adult development on the course of {AD}.},

These methods place limits on either the familywise error rate ({FWER}) or the false discovery rate ({FDR}) of the results. These principled approaches are well established in the literature and are known to properly limit the amount of false positives across the whole brain. However, a minority of papers are still published every month using methods that are improperly corrected for the number of tests conducted. These latter methods place limits on the voxelwise probability of a false positive and yield no information on the global rate of false positives in the results. In this commentary, we argue in favor of a principled approach to the multiple testing problem—one that places appropriate limits on the rate of false positives across the whole brain gives readers the information they need to properly evaluate the results.},

Because the effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by intracellular receptors including, most notably, the glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}), several studies have examined the number and/or function of {GR}'s in depressed patients. Review scientific evidences have consistently demonstrated that {GR} function is impaired in major depression, resulting in reduced {GR}-mediated negative feedback on the {HPA} axis and increased production and secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone ({CRH}) in various brain regions postulated to be involved in the causality of major depression. Hyperactivity of {HPA} axis is the main biochemical change, besides disturbed monoaminergic neurotransmission, observed in the patients suffering from a major depression. High incidence of depression in Cushing's syndrome as well as antidepressant effects of adrenocortical enzyme inhibitors in major depression support hypothesis that hyperactivity of {HPA} axis may be involved in pathogenesis of depression. Major alterations of the {HPA} axis that can be reversed by successful antidepressant therapy are often seen in depressed patients. A possible explanation for this is that the antidepressant-induced increase in {GR}'s renders the {HPA} axis more sensitive to glucocorticoid feedback. This new insight into antidepressant drug action suggests a novel approach to the development of antidepressant drugs.},

Research reviewed in this article probes the control processes that reconfigure mental resources for a change of task by requiring subjects to switch frequently among a small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses are substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone immediately after a task switch. This ‘switch cost’ is reduced, but not eliminated, by an opportunity for preparation. It seems to result from both transient and long-term carry-over of ‘task-set’ activation and inhibition as well as time consumed by task-set reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging studies of task switching have revealed extra activation in numerous brain regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate ‘controlling’ from ‘controlled’ regions.},

	abstract = {Social cognition is fundamentally interpersonal: individuals' behavior and dispositions critically affect their interaction partners' information processing. However, cognitive neuroscience studies, partially because of methodological constraints, have remained largely “perceiver-centric”: focusing on the abilities, motivations, and goals of social perceivers while largely ignoring interpersonal effects. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the neural bases of perceiving emotionally expressive and inexpressive social “targets.” Sixteen perceivers were scanned using {fMRI} while they watched targets discussing emotional autobiographical events. Perceivers continuously rated each target's emotional state or eye-gaze direction. The effects of targets' emotional expressivity on perceiver's brain activity depended on task set: when perceivers explicitly attended to targets' emotions, expressivity predicted activity in neural structures—including medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex—associated with drawing inferences about mental states. When perceivers instead attended to targets' eye-gaze, target expressivity predicted activity in regions—including somatosensory cortex, fusiform gyrus, and motor cortex—associated with monitoring sensorimotor states and biological motion. These findings suggest that expressive targets affect information processing in manner that depends on perceivers' goals. More broadly, these data provide an early step toward understanding the neural bases of interpersonal social cognition.},

Here we review the literature in both non-human primates and humans to assess the temporal pole's putative role in social and emotional processing. Reviewed findings indicate that it has some role in both social and emotional processes, including face recognition and theory of mind, that goes beyond semantic memory. We propose that the temporal pole binds complex, highly processed perceptual inputs to visceral emotional responses. Because perceptual inputs remain segregated into dorsal (auditory), medial (olfactory) and ventral (visual) steams, the integration of emotion with perception is channel specific.},

Reliable activity in pars opercularis, the frontal component of the {MNS}, was elicited by observation and imitation of emotional expressions. Importantly, activity in this region (as well as in the anterior insula and amygdala) was significantly and positively correlated with established behavioral measures indexing children's empathic behavior (during both imitation and observation) and interpersonal skills (during imitation only). These findings suggest that simulation mechanisms and the {MNS} may indeed be relevant to social functioning in everyday life during typical human development.},

Effective navigation of the social world relies on the correct interpretation of facial emotions. This may be particularly important in formative years. Critically, literature examining the emergence of face processing in youth (children and adolescents) has focused on the neural and behavioral correlates of processing adult faces, which are relationally different from youth participants, and whose facial expressions may convey different meaning than faces of their peers. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) scan, we compared concurrent neural and behavioral responses as youth (N = 25) viewed validated, emotionally varied (i.e., anger, fear, happy, and neutral) adult and child face stimuli. We observed that participants made fewer errors when matching adult, compared to child, face stimuli, and that while similar brain regions were involved in processing both adult and child faces, activation in the face processing neural network was greater for adult than child faces. This was true across emotions, and also when comparing neutral adult versus neutral child faces. Additionally, a valence by stimuli-type effect was observed within the amygdala. That is, within adult face stimuli, negative and neutral face stimuli elicited the largest effects, whereas within child face stimuli, happy face stimuli elicited the largest amygdala effects. Thus, heightened engagement of the amygdala was observed for happy child and angry adult faces, which may reflect age-specific salience of select emotions in early life. This study provides evidence that the relational age of the perceived face influences neural processing in youth.},

Melatonin, produced by the pineal gland at night, has a role in regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Among elderly people, even those who are healthy, the frequency of sleep disorders is high and there is an association with impairment of melatonin production. We investigated the effect of a controlled-release formulation of melatonin on sleep quality in 12 elderly subjects (aged 76 [{SD} 8] years) who were receiving various medications for chronic illnesses and who complained of insomnia.
In all 12 subjects the peak excretion of the main melatonin metabolite 6-sulphatoxymelatonin during the night was lower than normal and/or delayed in comparison with non-insomniac elderly people. In a randomised, double-blind, crossover study the subjects were treated for 3 weeks with 2 mg per night of controlled-release melatonin and for 3 weeks with placebo, with a week's washout period. Sleep quality was objectively monitored by wrist actigraphy. Sleep efficiency was significantly greater after melatonin than after placebo (83 [{SE} 4] vs 75 [3]\%, p{\textless}0·001) and wake time after sleep onset was significantly shorter (49 [14] vs 73 [13] min, p{\textless}0·001). Sleep latency decreased, but not significantly (19 [5] vs 33 [7] min, P=0·088). Total sleep time was not affected. The only adverse effects reported were two cases of pruritus, one during melatonin and one during placebo treatment; both resolved spontaneously.
Melatonin deficiency may have an important role in the high frequency of insomnia among elderly people. Controlled-release melatonin replacement therapy effectively improves sleep quality in this population.},

Nineteen individual items generate seven "component" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the {PSQI} were assessed over an 18-month period with "good" sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and "poor" sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global {PSQI} score {\textgreater} 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6\% and specificity of 86.5\% (kappa = 0.75, p [less-than-or-equals, slant] 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers.

Across levels of analysis theorists assume that emotions solve problems important to social relationships in the context of ongoing interactions. Theorists diverge, however, in their assumptions about the origins, defining characteristics, and consequences of emotions, and in their preferred forms of data. We illustrate the differences and compatibilities among these levels of analysis for the specific case of embarrassment. We close by suggesting research strategies that incorporate a social-functional perspective.},

Hedonistic reasoning declined in use until adolescence, and then increased somewhat in early adulthood. Needs-oriented and stereotypic reasoning increased until mid-childhood or early adolescence and then declined in use. Direct reciprocity and approval reasoning, which appeared to be on the decline in mid-adolescence in previous follow-ups, showed no decline into early adulthood. Several modes of higher-level reasoning increased in use across adolescence and early adulthood. Females' overall reasoning was higher than males'. Scores on interview and objective measures of prosocial moral reasoning were positively correlated. Consistent with expectations, there was some evidence of relations among prosocial reasoning, prosocial behavior, sympathy, and perspective taking.},

However, recent evidence that is inconsistent with dual-systems models illustrates the complexity of developmental and clinical variations in brain function.

Outcome measures included multiple dimensions of child and parent reported child pain, somatization, and functional disability, and school absences and physician contacts. Results Children and parents participating in the combined {SMC} + {CBT} intervention reported significantly less child and parent reported child abdominal pain than children in the {SMC} intervention immediately following the intervention and up to 1 year following study entry, as well as significantly fewer school absences. Significant differences in functional disability and somatization were not revealed. Conclusions These results, in combination with previous studies, add support to the effectiveness of {CBT} intervention in reducing the sensory aspects of {RAP}.

This technique has been valuable in elucidating the autonomic underpinnings of panic disorder ({PD}), a condition that is marked by reports of heart palpitations. A body of research has emerged that implicates a relative reduction in {HRV} and cardiac vagal tone in {PD}, as indicated by various {HRV} measures. These data are consistent with the cardiac symptoms of panic attacks, as well as with developmental evidence that links high vagal tone with enhanced attention, effective emotion regulation, and organismic responsivity. Implications of these findings for nosology and pathophysiology are discussed. Reports of reduced {HRV} in {PD} contrast with portrayals of excess autonomic lability in anxiety.

We first discuss “resting metabolism” and “passive activation” paradigms, used in neuroimaging and evoked potential studies, which merely identify neural activation reflecting “automatic” processing—that is, occurring without the patient's willful intervention. Secondly, we present an alternative approach consisting of instructing subjects to imagine well-defined sensory-motor or cognitive-mental actions. This strategy reflects volitional neural activation and, hence, witnesses awareness. Finally, we present results on blood-oxgen-level-dependent “default mode network”/resting state studies that might be a promising tool in the diagnosis of these challenging patients.},

	abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic ({WEIRD}) societies. Researchers – often implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that {WEIRD} subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of {IQ}. The findings suggest that members of {WEIRD} societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior – hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess sleep disturbances in subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) from an urban general population and to identify associated psychiatric disorders in these subjects. The study was performed with a representative sample of 1,832 respondents aged 15 to 90 years living in the Metropolitan Toronto area who were surveyed by telephone (participation rate, 72.8\%). Interviewers used Sleep-{EVAL}, an expert system specifically designed to conduct epidemiologic studies of sleep and mental disorders in the general population. Overall, 11.6\% of the sample reported having experienced a traumatic event, with no difference in the proportion of men and women. Approximately 2\% (1.8\%) of the entire sample were diagnosed by the system as having {PTSD} at the time of interview. The rate was higher for women (2.6\%) than for men (0.9\%), which translated into an odds ratio ({OR}) of 2.8 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.3 to 6.1). {PTSD} was strongly associated with other mental disorders: 75.7\% of respondents with {PTSD} received at least one other diagnosis. Most concurrent disorders (80.7\%) appeared after exposure to the traumatic event. Sleep disturbances also affected about 70\% of the {PTSD} subjects. Violent or injurious behaviors during sleep, sleep paralysis, sleep talking, and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations were more frequently reported in respondents with {PTSD}. Considering the relatively high prevalence of {PTSD} and its important comorbidity with other sleep and psychiatric disorders, an assessment of the history of traumatic events should be part of a clinician's routine inquiry in order to limit chronicity and maladjustment following a traumatic exposure. Moreover, complaints of rapid eye movement ({REM})-related sleep symptoms could be an indication of an underlying problem stemming from {PTSD}.},

Here we describe and validate an automated brain-mapping framework that uses text-mining, meta-analysis and machine-learning techniques to generate a large database of mappings between neural and cognitive states. We show that our approach can be used to automatically conduct large-scale, high-quality neuroimaging meta-analyses, address long-standing inferential problems in the neuroimaging literature and support accurate 'decoding' of broad cognitive states from brain activity in both entire studies and individual human subjects. Collectively, our results have validated a powerful and generative framework for synthesizing human neuroimaging data on an unprecedented scale.

An early influential view dichotomized these regions into dorsal–caudal cognitive and ventral–rostral affective subdivisions. In this review, we examine a wealth of recent research on negative emotions in animals and humans, using the example of fear or anxiety, and conclude that, contrary to the traditional dichotomy, both subdivisions make key contributions to emotional processing. Specifically, dorsal–caudal regions of the {ACC} and {mPFC} are involved in appraisal and expression of negative emotion, whereas ventral–rostral portions of the {ACC} and {mPFC} have a regulatory role with respect to limbic regions involved in generating emotional responses. Moreover, this new framework is broadly consistent with emerging data on other negative and positive emotions.},

For college students and the general population, means of weighted and unweighted correlations between intelligence and the strength of religious beliefs ranged from −.20 to −.25 (mean r = −.24). Three possible interpretations were discussed. First, intelligent people are less likely to conform and, thus, are more likely to resist religious dogma. Second, intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic (as opposed to intuitive) thinking style, which has been shown to undermine religious beliefs. Third, several functions of religiosity, including compensatory control, self-regulation, self-enhancement, and secure attachment, are also conferred by intelligence. Intelligent people may therefore have less need for religious beliefs and practices.},

Mutations associated with the serotonin transporter gene may result in changes in serotonin transporter function. The serotonin transporter gene promoter variant, consisting of a long (L) and a short (S) variant, is one of the major factors which contribute to the etiology of many psychiatric disorders. In this regard, many studies have been published on association of this variant with various psychiatric disorders. This repeat length variant in the promoter region of this gene has been shown to affect the rate of serotonin uptake and may play a role in post-traumatic stress disorder and depression-susceptibility in people experiencing emotional trauma. Associations between a functional variant in the serotonin transporter anxiety-related personality traits were found, as well as the risk of developing depression, alcoholism or suicidal behavior. Understanding of possible associations of these variants and psychiatric disorders would bring progress in principles and treatment of many disorders.},

By examining people's self-presentations to several targets across multiple dimensions, these 2 studies offer new insights into the nature of self-presentation and provide a novel paradigm for studying impression management. Results showed that most people rely on a relatively small number of basic self-presentational personas in which they convey particular profiles of impressions as a set and that these personas reflect both normative influences to project images that are appropriate to a particular target and distinctive influences by which people put an idiosyncratic spin on these normative images. Furthermore, although people's self-presentational profiles correlate moderately with their self-views, they tailor their public images to specific targets. The degree to which participants' self-presentations were normative and distinctive, as well as the extent to which they reflected their own self-views, were moderated by individual differences in agreeableness, self-esteem, authenticity, and Machiavellianism.},

	abstract = {Contemporary humans exhibit spectacular biological success derived from cumulative culture and cooperation. The origins of these traits may be related to our ancestral group structure. Because humans lived as foragers for 95\% of our species’ history, we analyzed co-residence patterns among 32 present-day foraging societies (total n = 5067 individuals, mean experienced band size = 28.2 adults). We found that hunter-gatherers display a unique social structure where (i) either sex may disperse or remain in their natal group, (ii) adult brothers and sisters often co-reside, and (iii) most individuals in residential groups are genetically unrelated. These patterns produce large interaction networks of unrelated adults and suggest that inclusive fitness cannot explain extensive cooperation in hunter-gatherer bands. However, large social networks may help to explain why humans evolved capacities for social learning that resulted in cumulative culture.},

Despite this wealth of information, there has been disagreement on how these data should be interpreted, arising in part because the relative magnitude of effect sizes in these domains is not known. To address this question, we conducted a meta-analysis to discover the effects of short-term {SD} on both speed and accuracy measures in 6 cognitive categories: simple attention, complex attention, working memory, processing speed, short-term memory, and reasoning. Seventy articles containing 147 cognitive tests were found that met inclusion criteria for this study. Effect sizes ranged from small and nonsignificant (reasoning accuracy: ḡ = −0.125, 95\% {CI} [−0.27, 0.02]) to large (lapses in simple attention: ḡ = −0.776, 95\% {CI} [−0.96, −0.60], p {\textless} .001). Across cognitive domains, significant differences were observed for both speed and accuracy; however, there were no differences between speed and accuracy measures within each cognitive domain. Of several moderators tested, only time awake was a significant predictor of between-studies variability, and only for accuracy measures, suggesting that heterogeneity in test characteristics may account for a significant amount of the remaining between-studies variance. The theoretical implications of these findings for the study of {SD} and cognition are discussed. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2010 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Much of this work has been accomplished within two basic schools of research, which we have labeled the “regression” and the “Bayesian” approaches. Each has its characteristic tasks and characteristic information that must be processed to accomplish these tasks. For the most part, researchers have tended to work strictly within a single approach and there has been minimal communication between the resultant subgroups of workers. Our objective here is to present a review and comparative analysis of these two approaches. Within each, we examine (a) the models that have been developed for describing and prescribing the use of information in decision making; (b) the major experimental paradigms, including the types of judgment, prediction, and decision tasks and the kinds of information that have been available to the decision maker in these tasks; (c) the key independent variables that have been manipulated in experimental studies; and (d) the major empirical results and conclusions. In comparing these approaches, we seek the answers to two basic questions. First, do the specific models and methods characteristic of different paradigms direct the researcher's attention to certain problems and cause him to neglect others that may be equally important? Second, can a researcher studying a particular substantive problem increase his understanding by employing diverse models and diverse experimental methods?},

The factors are linked to hedonic principles and basic appraisal tendencies.

Based upon the current literature, the strongest link is between subjective insomnia, lasting at least 2 weeks, and the later onset of depression. Less well-established data suggest that lifetime reports of at least 2 weeks of insomnia, hypersomnia, or both hypersomnia and insomnia, are risk factors for the later development of depression, anxiety disorders or substance abuse. More tentatively, preliminary data suggest that increasing subjective sleep disturbance may signal a relapse in remitted depressed patients. Sleep disturbances are common manifestations of major depressive and anxiety disorders. Therefore, sleep complaints may be among the most robust prodromal symptoms reflecting partial depressive or anxiety disorders, which eventually declare themselves as full-blown clinical episodes.},

Social exclusion and risk-taking are both common experiences of concern in adolescence, yet little is known about how the two may be related at behavioral or neural levels. In this {fMRI} study, adolescents (N = 27, 14 male, 14–17 years-old) completed a series of tasks in the scanner assessing risky decision-making before and after an episode of social exclusion. In this particular context, exclusion was associated with greater behavioral risk-taking among adolescents with low self-reported resistance to peer influence ({RPI}). When making risky decisions after social exclusion, adolescents who had lower {RPI} exhibited higher levels of activity in the right temporoparietal junction ({rTPJ}), and this response in {rTPJ} was a significant mediator of the relationship between {RPI} and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. Lower {RPI} was also associated with lower levels of activity in {lPFC} during crashes following social exclusion, but unlike {rTPJ} this response in {lPFC} was not a significant mediator of the relationship between {RPI} and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. The results suggest that mentalizing and/or attentional mechanisms have a unique direct effect on adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence on risk-taking.},

	abstract = {Empathy is an important social skill and is believed to play an essential role in moral development (Hoffman, 2000). In the present longitudinal study, the authors investigated adolescents’ development of perspective taking and empathic concern from age 13 to 18 years (mean age at Wave 1 = 13 years, {SD} = 0.46) and examined its association with pubertal status. Adolescents (283 boys, 214 girls) reported for 6 consecutive years on their dispositional perspective taking and empathic concern and for 4 consecutive years on pubertal status. Latent growth curve modeling revealed gender differences in levels and developmental trends. Gender differences in perspective taking emerged during adolescence, with girls’ increases being steeper than those of the boys. Girls also showed higher levels of empathic concern than did boys. Whereas girls’ empathic concern remained stable across adolescence, boys showed a decrease from early to middle adolescence with a rebound to the initial level thereafter. Boys who were physically more mature also reported lower empathic concern than did their less physically developed peers. The current study supports theoretical notions that perspective taking develops during adolescence as a result of cognitive development. Moreover, the results suggest that pubertal maturation plays a role in boys’ development of empathic concern.},

	abstract = {Emotional development is indisputably one of the cornerstones of personality development during infancy. According to the differential emotions theory ({DET}), primary emotions are constituted of three distinct components: the neural–evaluative, the expressive, and the experiential. The {DET} further assumes that these three components are biologically based and functional nearly from birth. Such a view entails that the neural substrate of primary emotions must be similar in children and adults. Guided by this assumption of the {DET}, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study was conducted to identify the neural correlates of sad feelings in healthy children. Fourteen healthy girls (aged 8–10) were scanned while they watched sad film excerpts aimed at externally inducing a transient state of sadness (activation task). Emotionally neutral film excerpts were also presented to the subjects (reference task). The subtraction of the brain activity measured during the viewing of the emotionally neutral film excerpts from that noted during the viewing of the sad film excerpts revealed that sad feelings were associated with significant bilateral activations of the midbrain, the medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area [{BA}] 10), and the anterior temporal pole ({BA} 21). A significant locus of activation was also noted in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({BA} 47). These results are compatible with those of previous functional neuroimaging studies of sadness in adults. They suggest that the neural substrate underlying the subjective experience of sadness is comparable in children and adults. Such a similitude provides empirical support to the {DET} assumption that the neural substrate of primary emotions is biologically based.},

While the concept of “efficiency” is vacuous as it is commonly employed in the neuroimaging literature, an examination of brain development in the context of neural coding, neuroenergetics, and network structure provides a roadmap for future investigation, which is fundamental to an improved understanding of developmental effects and group differences in neuroimaging signals.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

Sleep disturbances characterize depression and may reflect the abnormal persistence of brain activity from wakefulness into non-{REM} sleep. The goal of this study was to investigate the functional neuroanatomical correlates of non-{REM} sleep relative to presleep wakefulness in depressed patients and healthy subjects.


{METHOD}

Twelve medication-free depressed patients and 13 healthy subjects underwent polysomnography and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans during presleep wakefulness and non-{REM} sleep. Statistical parametric mapping contrasts were performed to detect differences in relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism between presleep wakefulness and non-{REM} sleep in each group as well as interactions across states and between groups.


{RESULTS}

Relative to healthy subjects, depressed patients showed less of a decrease in relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism from presleep wakefulness to non-{REM} sleep in the left and right laterodorsal frontal gyri, right medial prefrontal cortex, right superior and middle temporal gyri, insula, right posterior cingulate cortex, lingual gyrus, striate cortex, cerebellar vermis, and left thalamus.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Patterns of relative regional cerebral glucose metabolism changes from presleep wakefulness to non-{REM} sleep differ in healthy subjects and depressed patients. Specifically, the transition from wakefulness to non-{REM} sleep was characterized by the relative persistence of elevated metabolic activity in frontoparietal regions and thalamus in depressed patients compared with healthy subjects. These findings suggest that abnormal thalamocortical network function may underlie sleep anomalies and complaints of nonrestorative sleep in depressed patients.},

In this study, all 3 areas were assessed across methods and sources. Emotional expressiveness and empathy were evaluated in 73 children in 3 age groups (5-, 9-, and 13-year-olds) by measuring facial and verbal responses to emotionally evocative videotapes and by ratings from best friends, parents, and teachers. Measures of emotional insight and role taking were also obtained. Prosocial behaviors were assessed by 3 laboratory tasks and by ratings from best friends, parents, and teachers. Confirming expectations, latent variable path analyses (Lohmöller, 1984) indicated that emotional expressiveness, emotional insight, and role taking were strong predictors of latent empathy (multiple R2= .60). Boys' empathy, in turn, was a strong predictor of prosocial behavior, R2= .55. In contrast, girls' empathy was related to prosocial behaviors with friends, R2= .13, but not to cooperation with peers. Thus present findings provide important support and clarification for certain theoretical expectations, and also raise issues that need clarification.},

In Study 1, it was shown both among British and American samples that religious individuals preferred rule-based moral arguments to consequentialist moral arguments more than nonreligious individuals, and covariance with political conservatism did not account for this effect. Study 2 replicated these results with revisions to the materials and extended measures. In this study, dimensions of religiosity—particularly Christian Orthodoxy—predicted rule-based morality independent of a personal need for structure, need for cognition, and right-wing authoritarianism. These results imply that religious individuals who are committed to orthodox religious teaching display a deontological style of morality for reasons that extend beyond a need for structure, cognitive simplicity, or submission to authority.},

Individuals with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome cannot understand or engage in social situations despite preserved intellectual abilities. Recently, it has been suggested that oxytocin, a hormone known to promote mother-infant bonds, may be implicated in the social deficit of autism. We investigated the behavioral effects of oxytocin in 13 subjects with autism. In a simulated ball game where participants interacted with fictitious partners, we found that after oxytocin inhalation, patients exhibited stronger interactions with the most socially cooperative partner and reported enhanced feelings of trust and preference. Also, during free viewing of pictures of faces, oxytocin selectively increased patients’ gazing time on the socially informative region of the face, namely the eyes. Thus, under oxytocin, patients respond more strongly to others and exhibit more appropriate social behavior and affect, suggesting a therapeutic potential of oxytocin through its action on a core dimension of autism.},

	abstract = {The awakening cortisol response ({ACR}) is a discrete and distinctive part of the cortisol circadian cycle. In healthy adults salivary free cortisol concentrations increase by between 50 and 160\% in the first 30 min immediately post-awakening (approximate average increase of 9 nmol/l, range 4-15 nmol/l, estimated to be equivalent to about three secretory episodes). However there are no agreed norms for the absolute concentrations of free cortisol in saliva either immediately post-awakening (range of 4.7-18.5 nmol/l) or 30 min post-awakening (range of 8.6-21.9 nmol/l). This review explores reasons for these discrepancies in normative data including confounding factors such as gender, age, awakening time, light and participant adherence. Although the physiological role of the {ACR} has not been clearly defined evidence is discussed that suggests it is under a distinct regulatory influence, different from the rest of the diurnal cortisol secretory cycle. Despite the difficulties associated with its measurement a range of studies have demonstrated an association between the {ACR} and psychosocial variables, stress and health. However it remains unclear whether positive affect and good health are consistently associated with larger or smaller awakening responses. It is early days in the search for the role and significance of the {ACR}. Its putative role in the regulation of physiological function across the day (e.g. the immune system) and its sensitivity to psychosocial variables make it a prime candidate as an intermediary linking mind and health.},

While younger teenagers relish the opportunities to recreate continuously a highly-decorated, stylistically-elaborate identity, older teenagers favour a plain aesthetic that foregrounds their links to others, thus expressing a notion of identity lived through authentic relationships. The article further contrasts teenagers' graded conception of `friends' with the binary classification of social networking sites, this being one of several means by which online privacy is shaped and undermined by the affordances of these sites.},

	abstract = {There is considerable evidence now that recognition of emotion from facial expression occurs far above chance, at least for primary emotions. On the other hand, not much research is available studying the process of emotion recognition. An early theory was proposed by Lipps (1907), postulating that an ‘imitation drive’ accounts for this process. According to this theory, we tend to imitate a facial expression to which we are exposed, via feedback mechanisms we realize that our own imitated facial expression is associated with an emotion, and then we attribute this emotion to the person confronting us. Using Ekman \& Friesen's (1976) Pictures of Facial Affect, a study employing 20 subjects was conducted. During the first part subjects had to judge the emotions expressed in the pictures of facial affect. During this task the subjects were videotaped without their knowledge. About two weeks later the same subjects watched the video-recordings of their own expressions during the judgement task and had to judge which emotions they had decoded for the respective slides two weeks previously. Results indicate that decoding of emotions from own facial expression and decoding of the respective emotions from pictures of facial affect correspond to a degree above chance. The results are discussed with respect to the possible impact of imitation on the process of emotion recognition.},

	abstract = {Oxytocin ({OT}) is a neuropeptide synthesized in the paraventricular ({PVN}) and supraoptic nuclei ({SON}) in the hypothalamus. Although {OT} is more commonly known for its role in the milk-ejection reflex, in recent years research has indicated that {OT} participates in the expression of social behavior, memory processing, modulation of fear, and stress responses. The demonstration that {OT} influences affiliative behaviors, such as parental care and reproduction, and decreases anxiety has lead to speculations that it may have a role in mood disorders. Evidence from pharmacologic studies, pointing out the modulation of the {OT} system by serotonin, has argued in favor of {OT} as a mediator of serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}) antidepressant properties. In the present study, we investigated the distribution and overlap of {OT}-labeled cells and serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) immunoreactive ({IR}) fibers in the Macaque hypothalamus, utilizing immunocytochemical and double-immunofluorescent techniques. Consistent with previous reports, the distribution of {OT}-labeled cells in the hypothalamus is confined to the {PVN} and {SON}. In these nuclei, we demonstrate that the distribution of 5-{HTT}-labeled fibers follows the distribution of {OT}-labeled cells. Overlap of {OT}-labeled neurons and 5-{HTT}-{IR} fibers occurs in the parvicellular, magnocellular, dorsal, and posterior subdivisions of the {PVN}. In the {SON}, 5-{HTT}-labeled fibers and {OT}-labeled cells overlap in the ventromedial subdivision and in the 'capsular' part of the dorsolateral {SON}. These findings provide neuroanatomic support for the idea that {SSRIs}' therapeutic effects on social affiliation and anxiety may be mediated in part through components of the {OT} system.},

The presentation of a film or story turned out to be most effective in inducing both positive and negative mood states. The effects are especially large when subjects are explicitly instructed to enter the specified mood state. For elated mood, all other {MIPs} yielded considerably lower effectiveness scores. For the induction of negative mood states, Imagination, Velten, Music, Social Interaction and Feedback {MIPs} were about as effective as the Film/Story {MIP} without instruction. Induction effects covaried with several study characteristics. Effects tend to be smaller when demand characteristics are controlled or subjects are not informed about the purpose of the experiment. For behavioural measures, effects are smaller than for self-reports but still larger than zero. Hence, the effects of {MIPs} can be partly, but not fully due to demand effects.},

While participants’ accuracy rates for making honesty judgments were at chance levels, judgment biases were found based on participants own past cheating and lie-telling behaviors. Specifically, those who cheated and lied were biased towards believing that their peers would behave in the same manner. In contrast, participants who had not cheated were biased towards judging their peers as honest. These findings suggest that by 8 years of age there is a relation between one’s own deceptive behaviors and judgments of other’s honesty.},

	abstract = {Serotoninergic dysfunction is highly implicated in autism. Serotonin transporter gene ({SLC}6A4) that regulates synaptic serotonin level has been investigated as a candidate gene for autism, but consensus opinion on possible association is still lacking. Converging evidences of platelet-hyperserotoninemia in {\textasciitilde} 25\% of the patients, betterment of ritualistic behavior on administration of {SSRI} and linkage to chromosome 17q11 harboring {SLC}6A4, supports the hypothesis that {SLC}6A4 polymorphisms may contribute towards autism pathology. Our recent report on 5-{HTTLPR} marker represents the first study on genetic association of {SLC}6A4 with autism in the Indian population. Further analysis involving additional markers may reinforce the earlier hypothesis. So in the present study, we have investigated the association of a {VNTR} of 17 bp at intron2 ({STin}2) and an {SNP} at 3'{UTR} ({HTT}-3'{UTR}-{SNP}) of the gene with autism using family and population-based approaches. We have genotyped 421 individuals (93 autistic subjects, their parents and 160 controls) and consistent with other publications, family-based association studies using individual markers ({STin}2 and {HTT}-3'{UTR}-{SNP}) have not revealed any preferential allelic transmission to the probands. However, the interesting finding of strong linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) between the markers and significant disease-specific distortion in the distribution of {HTT}-3'{UTR}-{SNP} genotypes (T1[chi]2 = 5.19, P = 0.02; {OR} = 2.89, 95\% {CI} = 1.13-7.41) and the specific haplotypes of the two markers ({LRS} = 11.85, pc = 0.02), with higher frequencies of T/T genotype and 10-T haplotype in autistic cases suggests that either these markers or nearby markers of {SLC}6A4 that are in {LD}, may pose a risk towards autism in the Eastern Indian population.},

We therefore used functional brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine brain activity during intentional mimicry of emotional and non-emotional facial expressions and relate regional responses to the magnitude of expression-induced facial movement. Eighteen healthy subjects were scanned while imitating video clips depicting three emotional (sad, angry, happy), and two ‘ingestive’ (chewing and licking) facial expressions. Simultaneously, facial movement was monitored from displacement of fiducial markers (highly reflective dots) on each subject's face. Imitating emotional expressions enhanced activity within right inferior prefrontal cortex. This pattern was absent during passive viewing conditions. Moreover, the magnitude of facial movement during emotion-imitation predicted responses within right insula and motor/premotor cortices. Enhanced activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and frontal pole was observed during imitation of anger, in ventromedial prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate during imitation of sadness and in striatal, amygdala and occipitotemporal during imitation of happiness. Our findings suggest a central role for right inferior frontal gyrus in the intentional imitation of emotional expressions. Further, by entering metrics for facial muscular change into analysis of brain imaging data, we highlight shared and discrete neural substrates supporting affective, action and social consequences of somatomotor emotional expression.},

This review focuses on behavioral changes in this interval and is organized by the claim that a key set of these adolescent changes are part of a more general re-orientation of social behavior. More specifically we hypothesize that pubertal maturation is associated with the activation of social and motivational tendencies, which in turn influence behavior and emotion in adolescence depending upon interactions with social context. We focus on evidence for two examples of these motivational changes: (1) increases in sensation-seeking (motivational tendency to want to experience high-intensity, exciting experiences) and (2) stronger natural interest in—and pursuit of—contact with peers and potential romantic partners. We consider how these motivational changes contribute to the broader social re-orientation of adolescence, including exploration of social experiences, development of skills and knowledge relevant to taking on adult social roles, individuation from family, and establishment of an individual identity, all of which represent core developmental tasks during this period in the life span (Blakemore, 2008; Dahl \&amp; Spear, 2004; Steinberg \&amp; Morris, 2000). The paper also emphasizes the importance of investigating and understanding the direct influences of puberty on behavior and disentangling these from the broader set of changes during adolescent development.},

	abstract = {The serotonin transporter gene (5-{HTT}) plays a crucial role in serotonergic neurotransmission and has been found to be associated, with varying degrees of significance, with many diseases, including autism. Prior association studies of autism have yielded conflicting results regarding the association between two common 5-{HTT} polymorphisms, the promoter insertion/deletion (5-{HTTLPR}) and the intron 2 {VNTR} ({STin}2 {VNTR}). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to test the following hypotheses: (i) there is an association between autism and either or both of the 5-{HTTLPR} and {STin}2 {VNTR} polymorphisms, and (ii) the S allele of 5-{HTTLPR} and/or the {STin}2.12 allele of the {VNTR} are the specific risk alleles for autism. All published family-based and population based studies were examined to determine the overall strength of association between 5-{HTT} polymorphisms and autism. After exclusion of studies with overlapping samples and studies whose data did not allow for calculation of an odds ratio, 16 studies were included for final analyses, all but two of which used a family-based design. The meta-analysis failed to find a significant overall association between either of the 5-{HTT} polymorphisms examined and autism. Further, no allelic transmission distortion was found when studies of simplex (11 studies) and multiplex (3 studies) family samples were analyzed separately. However, there was significant heterogeneity by ethnicity; family based studies of {US} mixed population samples showed preferential transmission of the S allele of 5-{HTTLPR} (S allele:L allele = 247:183), while there was no allelic distortion among the family-based studies of European and Asian samples. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Lesion, functional imaging, and single-unit studies in human and nonhuman animals have demonstrated a role for the amygdala in processing stimuli with emotional and social significance. We investigated the recognition of a wide variety of facial expressions, including basic emotions (e.g., happiness, anger) and social emotions (e.g., guilt, admiration, flirtatiousness). Prior findings with a standardized set of stimuli indicated that recognition of social emotions can be signaled by the eye region of the face and is disproportionately impaired in autism (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, \& Jolliffe, 1997). To test the hypothesis that the recognition of social emotions depends on the amygdala, we administered the same stimuli to 30 subjects with unilateral amygdala damage (16 left, 14 right), 2 with bilateral amygdala damage, 47 brain-damaged controls, and 19 normal controls. Compared with controls, subjects with unilateral or bilateral amygdala damage were impaired when recognizing social emotions; moreover, they were more impaired in recognition of social emotions than in recognition of basic emotions, and, like previously described patients with autism, they were impaired also when asked to recognize social emotions from the eye region of the face alone. The findings suggest that the human amygdala is relatively specialized to process stimuli with complex social significance. The results also provide further support for the idea that some of the impairments in social cognition seen in patients with autism may result from dysfunction of the amygdala.},

There are several reasons why the analysis should include only voxels within a certain mask.

	abstract = {Throughout social and cognitive psychology, participants are routinely asked to respond in some way to experimental stimuli that are thought to represent categories of theoretical interest. For instance, in measures of implicit attitudes, participants are primed with pictures of specific African American and White stimulus persons sampled in some way from possible stimuli that might have been used. Yet seldom is the sampling of stimuli taken into account in the analysis of the resulting data, in spite of numerous warnings about the perils of ignoring stimulus variation (Clark, 1973; Kenny, 1985; Wells \& Windschitl, 1999). Part of this failure to attend to stimulus variation is due to the demands imposed by traditional analysis of variance procedures for the analysis of data when both participants and stimuli are treated as random factors. In this article, we present a comprehensive solution using mixed models for the analysis of data with crossed random factors (e.g., participants and stimuli). We show the substantial biases inherent in analyses that ignore one or the other of the random factors, and we illustrate the substantial advantages of the mixed models approach with both hypothetical and actual, well-known data sets in social psychology (Bem, 2011; Blair, Chapleau, \& Judd, 2005; Correll, Park, Judd, \& Wittenbrink, 2002).},

If de novo enzyme synthesis is assumed to take place in such increases, we could adopt the working hypothesis that two loci of glucocorticoid action may exist in serotonergic neurons with respect to their specific function: one in the cell body presumably in a sequence of macromolecular events, and the other directly on nerve terminals. Thus, in its immediate action, the hormone may rapidly regulate 5-{HT} synthesis through an increased uptake of tryptophan by nerve terminals. In the slow action, the hormone may mainly play a permissive role in the induction of tryptophan hydroxylase by factors yet to be identified.},

	abstract = {Sleep-related breathing disorders encompass a range of disorders in which abnormal ventilation occurs during sleep as a result of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, altered respiratory drive, abnormal chest wall movement, or respiratory muscle function. The most common of these is obstructive sleep apnea ({OSA}), occurring in both adults and children, and causing significant cognitive and daytime dysfunction and reduced quality of life. {OSA} patients experience repetitive brief cessation of breathing throughout the night, which causes intermittent hypoxemia (reductions in hemoglobin oxygen levels) and fragmented sleep patterns. These nocturnal events result in excessive daytime sleepiness, and changes in mood and cognition. Chronic excessive sleepiness during the day is a common symptom of sleep-related breathing disorders, which is assessed in sleep clinics both subjectively (questionnaire) and objectively (sleep latency tests). Mood changes are often reported by patients, including irritability, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. A wide range of cognitive deficits have been identified in untreated {OSA} patients, from attentional and vigilance, to memory and executive functions, and more complex tasks such as simulated driving. These changes are reflected in patient reports of difficulty in concentrating, increased forgetfulness, an inability to make decisions, and falling asleep at the wheel of a motor vehicle. These cognitive changes can also have significant downstream effects on daily functioning. Moderate to severe cases of the disorder are at a higher risk of having a motor vehicle accident, and may also have difficulties at work or school. A number of comorbidities may also influence the cognitive changes in {OSA} patients, including hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. These diseases can cause changes to neural vasculature and result in neural damage, leading to cognitive impairments. Examination of {OSA} patients using neuroimaging techniques such as structural magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has observed significant changes to brain structure and metabolism. The downstream effects of neural, cognitive, and daytime functional impairments can be significant if left untreated. A better understanding of the cognitive effects of these disorders, and development of more effective assessment tools for diagnosis, will aid early intervention and improve quality of life of the patient.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ({HDRS}) is widely used to measure the severity of depression in mood disorders. Total {HDRS} score correlates with brain metabolism as measured by fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([(18)F]-{FDG}) positron emission tomography. The {HDRS} comprises distinct symptom clusters that may be associated with different patterns of regional brain glucose metabolism.


{OBJECTIVE}

To examine associations between {HDRS} component psychopathologic clusters and resting glucose cerebral metabolism assessed by [(18)F]-{FDG} positron emission tomography. Patients We evaluated 298 drug-free patients who met the {DSM}-{III}-R criteria for major depressive disorder.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Five principal components were extracted from the 24-item {HDRS} for all subjects and {ProMax} rotated: psychic depression, loss of motivated behavior, psychosis, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. The [(18)F]-{FDG} scans were acquired in a subgroup of 43 drug-free patients in twelve 5-minute frames. Voxel-level correlation maps were generated with {HDRS} total and factor scores.


{RESULTS}

Total {HDRS} score correlated positively with activity in a large bilateral ventral cortical and subcortical region that included limbic, thalamic, and basal ganglia structures. Distinct correlation patterns were found with the 3 individual {HDRS} factors. Psychic depression correlated positively with metabolism in the cingulate gyrus, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Sleep disturbance correlated positively with metabolism in limbic structures and basal ganglia. Loss of motivated behavior was negatively associated with parietal and superior frontal cortical areas.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Different brain regions correlate with discrete symptom components that compose the overall syndrome of major depression. Future studies should extend knowledge about specific regional networks by identifying responsible neurotransmitters related to specific psychopathologic components of mood disorders.},

It was found that a particular face could reflect various emotions. All eigth emotions were reflected in the set of faces and the emotions were consensually judged. Moreover, gender differences in judgement could be established. Study 2: In a cross-over design, 24 healthy subjects judged the faces after listening to depressing or elating music. The faces were subdivided in six ‘ambiguous’ faces (i.e., expressing similar amounts of positive and negative emotions) and six ‘clear’ faces (i.e., faces showing a preponderance of positive or negative emotions). In addition, these two types of faces were distinguished with respect to the intensity of emotions they express. 11 subjects who showed substantial differences in experienced depression after listening to the music were selected for further analysis. It was found that, when feeling more depressed, the subjects perceived more rejection/sadness in ambiguous faces (displaying less intensive emotions) and less invitation/happiness in clear faces. In addition, subjects saw more fear in clear faces that express less intensive emotions. Hence, results show a depression-related negative bias in the perception of facial displays.},

	abstract = {Abstract The relation of preschool and kindergarten children's vicarious emotional responding to their social competence, regulation (attentional and coping styles), and emotionality (negative emotional intensity and dispositional negative affect) was examined. Vicarious responding was assessed by means of facial reactions to a film about a peer in a social conflict and children's reported negative affect to viewing peers' real-life negative emotion. Mothers and teachers reported on children's regulation and emotionality, social competence was assessed with sociometric nominations, teachers' reports, and observations of children's real-life anger reactions. Facial concerned attention during the film was associated with various measures of social competence, regulation, and low or moderate negative emotionality. Although negative vicarious emotional responding in real contexts was infrequently related to measures of interest, girls who reported intense negative vicarious emotional responses were relatively unregulated and low in social competence. Finally, with age, regulation of vicarious emotional responding was increasingly related to children's sociometric status and to girls' coping at school. Thus, as they get older, children's abilities to regulate emotions may take on increasing importance in others' evaluations of their social competencies.},

	abstract = {Summary
Depressed patients have reduced glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}) function, as demonstrated by resistance to the suppressive effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, and {GR} agonist, dexamethasone. We have developed a suppressive test with prednisolone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that is similar to cortisol in its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, and binds to both the {GR} and the mineralocorticoid receptor ({MR}). We have found that depressed patients suppress normally to prednisolone, unless they are particularly non-responsive to treatment. In the present study, we evaluated 28 inpatients with treatment-resistant depression ({TRD}), and compared salivary cortisol secretion (at 0900\&\#xa0;h, 1200\&\#xa0;h and 1700\&\#xa0;h) after placebo or after prednisolone (5\&\#xa0;mg), before and after an inpatient treatment admission. Half of the patients (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;14) reached treatment response. When comparing the assessment between admission and discharge, cortisol output after placebo fell (âˆ’26\% of area under the curve; p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.024) while the output after prednisolone did not change. Moreover, there was no change in the response to prednisolone (percentage suppression) between admission at discharge, and this was not influenced by treatment response. Finally, we could confirm and extend our previously published data with prednisolone (5\&\#xa0;mg), showing that depressed patients (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;12) and controls (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;12) suppressed equally to both 5 and 10\&\#xa0;mg doses of prednisolone. This study suggests that the response to prednisolone is similar in depressed patients and controls at different doses of prednisolone, and does not change with symptomatic improvement. This is in contrast with findings, from us and others, using other measures of hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal axis function, such as basal cortisol levels or the response to dexamethasone. Thus, we propose that the prednisolone suppression test may offer specific biological and clinical information, related to its action at both the {GR} and the {MR}.},

Set within the wider context of the Internet and society it investigates how geographically distant individuals are coming together on the Internet to inhabit new kinds of social spaces or virtual communities. People ‘live in’ and ‘construct’ these new spaces in such a way as to suggest that the Internet is not a placeless cyberspace that is distinct and separate from the real world. Building on the work of other cyberethnographers, the author combines original ethnographic research in Cybercity, a Virtual Community, with face-to-face meetings to illustrate how, for many people, cyberspace is just another place to meet. Second, she suggests that people in Cybercity are investing as much effort in maintaining relationships in cyberspace as in other social spaces. Her preliminary analysis suggests that by extending traditional human relationships into Cybercity, they are widening their webs of relationships, not weakening them. Human relationships in cyberspace are formed and maintained in similar ways to those in wider society. Rather than being exotic and removed from real life, they are actually being assimilated into everyday life. Furthermore, they are often moved into other social settings, just as they are in offline life.},

Evaluation of time order is particularly useful in epidemiologic studies concerned with exposure to potentially toxic substances and subsequent outcome, but may also have use in more traditional growth studies that relate intake to subsequent development. The analysis allows for unequally spaced measures and missing data. The estimation method permits varying numbers of observations per subject and, with measures equally spaced, one can fit the model with use of ordinary least squares regression software. We report on a potential false association that can result when both exposure and outcome are related to time. We illustrate this problem with a small scale simulation and example. We also note a more serious problem with Rosner's approach in interpreting parameters. Although the model may be useful for prediction, parameters depend on the autocorrelation and are not readily interpretable. We recommend alternative modelling strategies be used when autocorrelation of errors is suspected.},

In this study, we examined neural responses to investigate whether and how other brain areas anatomically connected to the amygdala might become activated during both overt and covert presentation of conditioned emotional visual stimuli. In the covert presentation, a conditioned angry face was shown for 15 ms followed by a neutral masking face ({CSmask}). In the overt condition, an angry face associated with a painful stimulus ({CS}+), a happy (H) and a neutral face (N) were presented for 75 ms.

Based on results of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) in 10 healthy volunteers, we show evidence that a network of brain structures anatomically connected to the amygdala (including the anterior insula, the fusiform gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus) are involved in the subliminal processing of visual emotional stimuli. Of particular interest was the dissociation between the anterior and posterior insula: the anterior insula responded to both overt and covert presentation of the conditioned stimulus, whereas the posterior insula responded only to the overt presentation of the face associated with a painful electrical stimulation. This response pattern suggests that the anterior insula, the fusiform gyrus and the temporal sulcus cooperate with the amygdala in the unconscious processing of pain-conditioned stimuli.},

	abstract = {The problem of the self has been of increasing interest in recent neuroscience. Brain imaging studies have raised the question of whether neural activity in cortical midline regions is self-specific and whether self-specific activity is related to resting state activity ({RSA}). A quantitative meta-analysis that included 87 studies, representing 1433 participants, was conducted to discuss these questions. First, the specificity of the self (e.g. hearing one's own name, seeing one's own face) was tested and compared across familiar (using stimuli from personally known people) and other (non-self–non-familiar, i.e. strangers and widely-known figures) conditions. Second, the relationship between the self and resting state activity, as reflected by the default-mode network ({DMN}), was tested. The results indicated that the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex ({PACC}) is specifically involved in self-processing when compared to familiarity, other, and task/stimulus effects. On the contrary, other midline regions, i.e., medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) and posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}) were functionally unspecific as they were recruited during the processing of both self-specific and familiar stimuli. Finally, the {PACC} was recruited during self-specific stimuli and this activity overlapped with {DMN} activity during resting state, thus distinguishing the self-related processing from both that of the familiar and other conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that our sense of self may result from a specific kind of interaction between resting state activity and stimulus-induced activity, i.e., rest–stimulus interaction, within the midline regions.},

	abstract = {Individual differences in impulsivity underlie a good deal of the risk taking that is observed during adolescence, and some of the most hazardous forms of this behavior are linked to impulsivity traits that are evident early in development. However, early interventions appear able to reduce the severity and impact of these traits by increasing control over behavior and persistence toward valued goals, such as educational achievement. One form of impulsivity, sensation seeking, rises dramatically during adolescence and increases risks to healthy development. However, a review of the evidence for the hypothesis that limitations in brain development during adolescence restrict the ability to control impulsivity suggests that any such limitations are subtle at best. Instead, it is argued that lack of experience with novel adult behavior poses a much greater risk to adolescents than structural deficits in brain maturation. Continued translational research will help to identify strategies that protect youth as they transition to adulthood. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Dev Psychobiol 52: 263–276, 2010},

	abstract = {A sample of 335 five-year-old children participating in an ongoing longitudinal study was the focus of a study on the effects of emotional and behavioral challenge on cardiac activity in children with different patterns of early childhood behavior problems. The children were placed in one of three behavior problem groups (low behavior problems, risk for externalizing problems, risk for mixed externalizing/internalizing problems) based on their scores on the Child Behavior Checklist for 4-18 year-olds (), completed by their mothers. To assess cardiac vagal regulation, resting measures of respiratory sinus arrhythmia ({RSA}) and {RSA} change (vagal withdrawal) to five emotionally and behaviorally challenging tasks were derived. In addition, Heart period ({HP}) and Heart period change ({HR} acceleration) was examined. Results indicated that the behavior problem groups did not differ in terms of resting measures of either {RSA} or {HP}. Analyses of the challenge tasks indicated that the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater cardiac vagal withdrawal across the five tasks than did the other two groups of children. There was a trend for the children at risk for externalizing problems to display less vagal withdrawal than the control group. In addition, the children at risk for mixed problems displayed greater heart rate acceleration to the tasks than did the other two groups of children. Follow-up analyses indicated that the greater cardiac acceleration observed in the mixed group was largely a function of greater vagal withdrawal. These findings are discussed in terms of the emotion regulatory function of cardiac vagal regulation, and its implications for patterns of risk for behavior problems in young children.},

This indicates that greater attention to one’s bodily state may contribute to the development of intense negative emotions and anxiety disorders. We hypothesized that reactivity in the anterior insular cortex underlies the intensity of interoceptive awareness and anxiety. To elucidate this triadic mechanism, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and mediation analyses to examine the relationship between emotional disposition and activation in the anterior insular cortex while participants evaluated their own emotional and bodily states. Our results indicated that right anterior insular activation was positively correlated with individual levels of social anxiety and neuroticism, and negatively correlated with agreeableness and extraversion. The results of the mediation analyses revealed that activity in the right anterior insula mediated the activity of neural correlates of interoceptive sensibility and social fear. Our findings suggest that attention to interoceptive sensation affects personality traits, through how we feel emotion subjectively in various situations.},

	abstract = {Short-term sleep loss is known to cause temporary difficulties in cognition, behaviour and health but the effects of persistent sleep deprivation on brain development have received little or no attention. Yet, severe sleep disorders that last for years are common in children especially when they have neurodevelopmental disabilities. There is increasing evidence that chronic sleep loss can lead to neuronal and cognitive loss in children although this is generally unrecognized by the medical profession and the public. Without the restorative functions of sleep due to total sleep deprivation, death is inevitable within a few weeks. Chronic sleep disturbances at any age deprive children of healthy environmental exposure which is a prerequisite for cognitive growth more so during critical developmental periods. Sleep loss adversely effects pineal melatonin production which causes disturbance of circadian physiology of cells, organs, neurochemicals, neuroprotective and other metabolic functions. Through various mechanisms sleep loss causes widespread deterioration of neuronal functions, memory and learning, gene expression, neurogenesis and numerous other changes which cause decline in cognition, behaviour and health. When these changes are long-standing, excessive cellular stress develops which may result in widespread neuronal loss. In this review, for the first time, recent research advances obtained from various fields of sleep medicine are integrated in order to show that untreated chronic sleep disorders may lead to impaired brain development, neuronal damage and permanent loss of developmental potentials. Further research is urgently needed because these findings have major implications for the treatment of sleep disorders.},

For example, research identifying and explaining health disparities across demographic strata may seek to understand the health effects of patient attitudes or private behaviors. Such personal attributes are difficult or impossible to observe directly and are often best measured by self-reports. Defensible use of self-reports in quantitative comparative research requires not only that the measured constructs have the same meaning across groups, but also that group comparisons of sample estimates (eg, means and variances) reflect true group differences and are not contaminated by group-specific attributes that are unrelated to the construct of interest. Evidence for these desirable properties of measurement instruments can be established within the confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) framework; a nested hierarchy of hypotheses is tested that addresses the cross-group invariance of the instrument’s psychometric properties. By name, these hypotheses include configural, metric (or pattern), strong (or scalar), and strict factorial invariance. The {CFA} model and each of these hypotheses are described in nontechnical language. A worked example and technical appendices are included.},

A trait measure of self-reported religiosity did not seem to be associated with prosocial behavior. We discuss different possible mechanisms that may underlie this effect, focusing on the hypotheses that the religious prime had an ideomotor effect on generosity or that it activated a felt presence of supernatural watchers.

Polysomnographic studies have shown that, in comparison to normal subjects, the sleep of patients with panic disorder is characterized by longer sleep latency, increased time awake and reduced sleep efficiency. Sleep architecture is normal and there are no significant changes in {REM} sleep measures. Nocturnal panic attacks are non-{REM}-related events and occur without an obvious trigger in 18-45\% of panic disorder patients. Regarding generalized anxiety disorder, the patients complain of 'trouble sleeping' in 60-70\%, while polysomnography has shown increased sleep latency and decreased sleep continuity measures. The findings in {REM} sleep and sleep architecture generally do not show any aberration to exist. In patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}) and post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}), results from the sleep laboratory do not seem to support the subjective complaints of poor sleep.

	abstract = {Children reared in unfavorable socioeconomic circumstances show increased susceptibility to the chronic diseases of aging when they reach the fifth and sixth decades of life. One mechanistic hypothesis for this phenomenon suggests that social adversity in early life programs biological systems in a manner that persists across decades and thereby accentuates vulnerability to disease. Here we examine the basic tenets of this hypothesis by performing genome-wide transcriptional profiling in healthy adults who were either low or high in socioeconomic status ({SES}) in early life. Among subjects with low early-life {SES}, there was significant up-regulation of genes bearing response elements for the {CREB}/{ATF} family of transcription factors that conveys adrenergic signals to leukocytes, and significant down-regulation of genes with response elements for the glucocorticoid receptor, which regulates the secretion of cortisol and transduces its antiinflammatory actions in the immune system. Subjects from low-{SES} backgrounds also showed increased output of cortisol in daily life, heightened expression of transcripts bearing response elements for {NF}-κB, and greater stimulated production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6. These disparities were independent of subjects' current {SES}, lifestyle practices, and perceived stress. Collectively, these data suggest that low early-life {SES} programs a defensive phenotype characterized by resistance to glucocorticoid signaling, which in turn facilitates exaggerated adrenocortical and inflammatory responses. Although these response patterns could serve adaptive functions during acute threats to well-being, over the long term they might exact an allostatic toll on the body that ultimately contributes to the chronic diseases of aging.},

Previous studies have shown the importance of orbitofrontal–hippocampal interactions in the better remembering of attractive faces, and psychological data have indicated that faces giving an impression of untrustworthiness are remembered more accurately than those giving an impression of trustworthiness. However, the neural mechanisms of the latter effect are largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we investigated neural activities with event-related {fMRI} while the female participants rated their impressions of the personalities of men in terms of trustworthiness. After the rating, memory for faces was tested to identify successful encoding activity. As expected, faces that gave bad impressions were remembered better than those that gave neutral or good impressions. In {fMRI} data, right insular activity reflected an increasing function of bad impressions, and bilateral hippocampal activities predicted subsequent memory success. Additionally, correlation between these insular and hippocampal regions was significant only in the encoding of faces associated with a bad impression. Better memory for faces associated with an impression of bad personality could reflect greater interaction between the avoidance-related insular region and the encoding-related hippocampal region.},

	abstract = {Background: There is a need for an easily administered instrument which can be applied to all patients with restless legs syndrome ({RLS}) to measure disease severity for clinical assessment, research, or therapeutic trials. The pathophysiology of {RLS} is not clear and no objective measure so far devised can apply to all patients or accurately reflect severity. Moreover, {RLS} is primarily a subjective disorder. Therefore, a subjective scale is at present the optimal instrument to meet this need.

Methods: Twenty centers from six countries participated in an initial reliability and validation study of a rating scale for the severity of {RLS} designed by the International {RLS} study group ({IRLSSG}). A ten-question scale was developed on the basis of repeated expert evaluation of potential items. This scale, the {IRLSSG} rating scale ({IRLS}), was administered to 196 {RLS} patients, most on some medication, and 209 control subjects.

Results: The {IRLS} was found to have high levels of internal consistency, inter-examiner reliability, test–retest reliability over a 2–4 week period, and convergent validity. It also demonstrated criterion validity when tested against the current criterion of a clinical global impression and readily discriminated patient from control groups. The scale was dominated by a single severity factor that explained at least 59\% of the pooled item variance.

Conclusions: This scale meets performance criteria for a brief, patient completed instrument that can be used to assess {RLS} severity for purposes of clinical assessment, research, or therapeutic trials. It supports a finding that {RLS} is a relatively uniform disorder in which the severity of the basic symptoms is strongly related to their impact on the patient's life. In future studies, the {IRLS} should be tested against objective measures of {RLS} severity and its sensitivity should be studied as {RLS} severity is systematically manipulated by therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Influences on the perception of affordances (i.e., opportunities for actions) have been primarily studied by manipulating the functional morphology of the body. However, affordances are not just determined by the functional morphology of the perceiver, but also by the physiological state of the perceiver. States of anxiety have been shown to lead to marked changes in individuals’ physiological state and their behaviour. To assess the influence of emotional state on affordance perception, the perception of action capabilities in near space was examined after participants completed an anxiety-provoking task. Anxiety was induced immediately prior to tasks that assessed participants' perceived reaching ability in Experiment 1, grasping ability in Experiment 2, and the ability to pass their hands through apertures in Experiment 3. Results indicated that those participants who experienced changes in anxiety underestimated their reaching, grasping, and passing ability compared to non-anxious participants. In other words, anxious participants were more conservative in their estimations of their action capabilities. These results suggest that anxiety influences the perception for affordances in near space and are consistent with the notion that anxiety induces withdrawal behaviours.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in the behavioral sciences, with key advantages including increased power, more comprehensive measurement, and establishment of temporal precedence. One particularly salient strength offered by longitudinal data is the ability to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects in the regression of an outcome on a time-varying covariate. However, the ability to disaggregate these effects has not been fully capitalized upon in many social science research applications. Two likely reasons for this omission are the general lack of discussion of disaggregating effects in the substantive literature and the need to overcome several remaining analytic challenges that limit existing quantitative methods used to isolate these effects in practice. This review explores both substantive and quantitative issues related to the disaggregation of effects over time, with a particular emphasis placed on the multilevel model. Existing analytic methods are reviewed, a general approach to the problem is proposed, and both the existing and proposed methods are demonstrated using several artificial data sets. Potential limitations and directions for future research are discussed, and recommendations for the disaggregation of effects in practice are offered.},

	abstract = {The optimal responses for many decisions faced by humans are ill defined, yet we are able to choose well by associating choices with outcomes, and employing this information in decision making. Previous studies suggest that the parietal cortex is involved in “uncertain” decision making, yet uncertainty is confounded with increased difficulty and attention. Here we aim to dissociate the role of parietal cortex in decision making and attention. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we measured brain activity while participants played a “matching-pennies” game. We found that the inferior parietal lobule is involved in decision making under uncertainty, showing higher activity when the decision was uncertain rather than certain and when humans were given trial-by-trial feedback on choice outcomes than when they were not. Crucially, increasing attentional load with secondary tasks reduced inferior parietal activity when decisions were made under uncertainty, suggesting that general attention does not drive its activation. This pattern was consistent for visual or auditory feedback, and for direct (symbols representing wins and losses) or indirect (only the opponent's choices were shown) feedback. It contrasted with results from medial superior frontal gyrus, which was driven primarily by increased attentional load. We suggest that decision making under uncertainty is dissociable from general attention in the brain.},

Studies also show sex differences in human brains but do not explain this complementarity. In this work, we modeled the structural connectome using diffusion tensor imaging in a sample of 949 youths (aged 8–22 y, 428 males and 521 females) and discovered unique sex differences in brain connectivity during the course of development. Connection-wise statistical analysis, as well as analysis of regional and global network measures, presented a comprehensive description of network characteristics. In all supratentorial regions, males had greater within-hemispheric connectivity, as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity, whereas between-hemispheric connectivity and cross-module participation predominated in females. However, this effect was reversed in the cerebellar connections. Analysis of these changes developmentally demonstrated differences in trajectory between males and females mainly in adolescence and in adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that male brains are structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitate communication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.},

Through its association with Hsp90, {FKBP}51 regulates the glucocorticoid receptor ({GR}). Single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) in the {FKBP}5 gene associate with increased recurrence of depressive episodes, increased susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, attempt of suicide, and major depressive disorder in {HIV} patients. Variation in one of these {SNPs} correlates with increased levels of {FKBP}51. {FKBP}51 is also increased in {HIV} patients. Moreover, increases in {FKBP}51 in the amygdala produce an anxiety phenotype in mice. Therefore, we tested the behavioral consequences of {FKBP}5 deletion in aged mice. Similar to that of naïve animals treated with classical antidepressants {FKBP}5-/- mice showed antidepressant behavior without affecting cognition and other basic motor functions. Reduced corticosterone levels following stress accompanied these observed effects on depression. Age-dependent anxiety was also modulated by {FKBP}5 deletion. Therefore, drug discovery efforts focused on depleting {FKBP}51 levels may yield novel antidepressant therapies.},

Finally, most talks and blog posts (see e.g. many good ones on r-bloggers) describe how to use it or reflect on how awesome the {API} is (which cannot be reiterated enough!), but only a few posts speak about performance.

	abstract = {Previous studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding the association of the serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) gene with autism. Two polymorphisms have been identified in the human 5-{HTT} gene, a {VNTR} in intron 2¹ and a functional deletion/insertion in the promoter region (5-{HTTLPR}) with short and long variants. Positive associations of the 5-{HTTLPR} polymorphism with autism have been reported by two family-based studies, but one found preferential transmission of the short allele and the other of the long allele. Two subsequent studies failed to find evidence of transmission disequilibrium at the 5-{HTTLPR} locus. These conflicting results could be due to heterogeneity of clinical samples with regard to serotonin (5-{HT}) blood levels, which have been found to be elevated in some autistic subjects. Thus, we examined the association of the 5HTTLPR and {VNTR} polymorphisms of the 5-{HTT} gene with autism, and we investigated the relationship between 5-{HTT} variants and whole-blood 5-{HT}. The transmission/disequilibrium test ({TDT}) revealed no linkage disequilibrium at either loci in a sample of 96 families comprising 43 trios and 53 sib pairs. Furthermore, no significant relationship between 5-{HT} blood levels and 5-{HTT} gene polymorphisms was found. Our results suggest that the 5-{HTT} gene is unlikely to play a major role as a susceptibility factor in autism. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]},

	abstract = {To determine whether a cumulative sleep debt (in a range commonly experienced) would result in cumulative changes in measures of waking neurobehavioral alertness, 16 healthy young adults had their sleep restricted 33\% below habitual sleep duration, to an average 4.98 hours per night [standard deviation ({SD}) = 0.57] for seven consecutive nights. Subjects slept in the laboratory, and sleep and waking were monitored by staff and actigraphy. Three times each day (1000, 1600, and 2200 hours) subjects were assessed for subjective sleepiness ({SSS}) and mood ({POMS}) and were evaluated on a brief performance battery that included psychomotor vigilance ({PVT}), probed memory ({PRM}), and serial-addition testing, Once each day they completed a series of visual analog scales ({VAS}) and reported sleepiness and somatic and cognitive/emotional problems. Sleep restriction resulted in statistically robust cumulative effects on waking functions. {SSS} ratings, subscale scores for fatigue, confusion, tension, and total mood disturbance from the {POMS} and {VAS} ratings of mental exhaustion and stress were evaluated across days of restricted sleep (p = 0.009 to p = 0.0001). {PVT} performance parameters, including the frequency and duration of lapses, were also significantly increased by restriction (p = 0.018 to p = 0.0001). Significant time-of-day effects were evident in {SSS} and {PVT} data, but time-of-day did not interact with the effects of sleep restriction across days. The temporal profiles of cumulative changes in neurobehavioral measures of alertness as a function of sleep restriction were generally consistent. Subjective changes tended to precede performance changes by 1 day, but overall changes in both classes of measure were greatest during the first 2 days (P1, P2) and last 2 days (P6, P7) of sleep restriction. Data from subsets of subjects also showed: 1) that significant decreases in the {MSLT} occurred during sleep restriction, 2) that the elevated sleepiness and performance deficits continued beyond day 7 of restriction, and 3) that recovery from these deficits appeared to require two full nights of sleep. The cumulative increase in performance lapses across days of sleep restriction correlated closely with {MSLT} results (r = -0.95) from an earlier comparable experiment by Carskadon and Dement (1). These findings suggest that cumulative nocturnal sleep debt had a dynamic and escalating analog in cumulative daytime sleepiness and that asymptotic or steady-state sleepiness was not achieved in response to sleep restriction.},

The categorizations we use, despite their multitude, frequently take the form of the general ingroup/outgroup distinction. A meta-analysis of 33 {fMRI} studies, reporting selective activations to various social groups, was used to identify common neural structures responsible for relational representation of social structure. Activation Likelihood Estimation ({ALE}) analysis revealed areas in bilateral amygdala, cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, right {TPJ} and right insula as implementing various aspects of social categorization. Activation of amygdala can be associated with modulation of behavioral response to subjectively significant stimuli. A more ventral part of anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) can be associated with self-referential reasoning about ingroup members while a more dorsal part of {ACC} is involved in the regulation of emotions toward outgroup members. Right insula can be engaged in the modulation of outgroup avoidance behavior. Fusiform gyrus ({FG}) appears to be directly involved in social categorization process via top-down modulation of social perception. Yet it is difficult to associate any of the revealed clusters with the relational ingroup/outgroup structure.},

Results indicated that age exerted both linear and quadratic effects on regulation success but was unrelated to emotional reactivity. Study 2 replicated and extended these findings using a different reappraisal task and further showed that situational (i.e., social vs. nonsocial stimuli) and dispositional (i.e., level of rejection sensitivity) social factors interacted with age to predict regulation success: young adolescents were less successful at regulating responses to social than to nonsocial stimuli, particularly if the adolescents were high in rejection sensitivity.

This is comparable to the difference between males and females and twice the risk estimated for maternal age over 40.

We identify a set of secondary clusters that support the existence of the primary clusters.

A hierarchical approach can be taken to modelling such data with a general linear model ({GLM}) at each level of the hierarchy introducing different random effects variance components. Inferring on these models is nontrivial with frequentist solutions being unavailable. A solution is to use a Bayesian framework. One important ingredient in this is the choice of prior on the variance components and top-level regression parameters. Due to the typically small numbers of sessions or subjects in neuroimaging, the choice of prior is critical. To alleviate this problem, we introduce to neuroimage modelling the approach of reference priors, which drives the choice of prior such that it is noninformative in an information-theoretic sense. We propose two inference techniques at the top level for multilevel hierarchies (a fast approach and a slower more accurate approach). We also demonstrate that we can infer on the top level of multilevel hierarchies by inferring on the levels of the hierarchy separately and passing summary statistics of a noncentral multivariate t distribution between them.},

In particular, we wished to test Eysenck's biological theory of personality, which links high extraversion to lower levels of reticulothalamic–cortical arousal, and neuroticism to increased reactivity of the limbic system and stronger reactions to emotional arousal. Individuals high in neuroticism demonstrated reduced sustained activation in the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) and attenuated valence processing in the right temporal lobe while viewing emotional images, but an increased {BOLD} response to emotional arousal in the right medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}). These results support Eysenck's theory, as well as our hypothesis that high levels of neuroticism are associated with attenuated reward processing. Extraversion was inversely related to arousal processing in the right cerebellum, but positively associated with arousal processing in the right insula, indicating that the relationship between extraversion and arousal is not as simple as that proposed by Eysenck.},

	abstract = {Whole brain {fMRI} analyses rarely include the entire brain because of missing data that result from data acquisition limits and susceptibility artifact, in particular. This missing data problem is typically addressed by omitting voxels from analysis, which may exclude brain regions that are of theoretical interest and increase the potential for Type {II} error at cortical boundaries or Type I error when spatial thresholds are used to establish significance. Imputation could significantly expand statistical map coverage, increase power, and enhance interpretations of {fMRI} results. We examined multiple imputation for group level analyses of missing {fMRI} data using methods that leverage the spatial information in {fMRI} datasets for both real and simulated data. Available case analysis, neighbor replacement, and regression based imputation approaches were compared in a general linear model framework to determine the extent to which these methods quantitatively (effect size) and qualitatively (spatial coverage) increased the sensitivity of group analyses. In both real and simulated data analysis, multiple imputation provided 1) variance that was most similar to estimates for voxels with no missing data, 2) fewer false positive errors in comparison to mean replacement, and 3) fewer false negative errors in comparison to available case analysis. Compared to the standard analysis approach of omitting voxels with missing data, imputation methods increased brain coverage in this study by 35\% (from 33,323 to 45,071 voxels). In addition, multiple imputation increased the size of significant clusters by 58\% and number of significant clusters across statistical thresholds, compared to the standard voxel omission approach. While neighbor replacement produced similar results, we recommend multiple imputation because it uses an informed sampling distribution to deal with missing data across subjects that can include neighbor values and other predictors. Multiple imputation is anticipated to be particularly useful for 1) large {fMRI} data sets with inconsistent missing voxels across subjects and 2) addressing the problem of increased artifact at ultra-high field, which significantly limit the extent of whole brain coverage and interpretations of results.},

	abstract = {Humans possess a remarkable capacity to understand the suffering of others. Cognitive neuroscience theories of empathy suggest that this capacity is supported by ‘shared representations’ of self and other. Consistent with this notion, a number of studies have found that perceiving others in pain and experiencing pain oneself recruit overlapping neural systems. Perception of pain in each of these conditions, however, may also cause unique patterns of activation, that may reveal more about the processing steps involved in each type of pain. To address this issue, we examined neural activity while participants experienced heat pain and watched videos of other individuals experiencing injuries. Results demonstrated (i) that both tasks activated anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, consistent with prior work; (ii) whereas self-pain activated anterior and mid insula regions implicated in interoception and nociception, other pain activated frontal, premotor, parietal and amygdala regions implicated in emotional learning and processing social cues; and (iii) that levels of trait anxiety correlated with activity in rostral lateral prefrontal cortex during perception of other pain but not during self-pain. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that perception of pain in self and other, while sharing some neural commonalities, differ in their recruitment of systems specifically associated with decoding and learning about internal or external cues.},

The dexamethasone suppression test ({DST}), frequently abnormal in mood disorder patients, is considered to measure glucocorticoid receptor-mediated negative feedback. We examined the hypothesis that the, apparently more sensitive, dexamethasone/corticotrophin-releasing-hormone (dex/{CRH}) test unveils subtle hypothalamicâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenal axis disturbance not detected by the {DST} in 82 patients with mood disorders and 28 controls. There was a close correlation between the cortisol responses on the two tests (rs=0.73, p\&lt;0.0005). However, {ROC} analysis revealed that the dex/{CRH} test had better diagnostic performance than the {DST} (p=0.031). The sensitivity of delta cortisol (from the dex/{CRH}) was 61.9\% and the specificity 71.4\%. The sensitivity of 1500\&\#xa0;h cortisol (the {DST}) was 66.6\% and the specificity was 47.6\%. This suggests that the two tests measure common pathology but that the dex/{CRH} test has better diagnostic utility.},

Parent-offspring transmission of the long (/) and short (s) alleles of the deletion/insertion polymorphism in the {HTT} promoter region was examined in families of 71 children with autism using the transmission test for linkage disequilibrium ({TDT}). Transmission of {HTT} promoter alleles did not differ between probands with autism and their unaffected siblings. However, allelic transmission in probands was dependent upon severity of impairments in the social and communication domains, with greater s allele transmission in severely impaired individuals and greater I transmission in mild/moderately impaired individuals. This relationship between {HTT} promoter alleles and severity of autistic impairment was also seen when ratings of social and communication behaviors were compared across genotypes. The data indicate that {HTT} promoter alleles by themselves do not convey risk for autism, but, rather, modify the severity of autistic behaviors in the social and communication domains. The results require replication and, given the size of the groups and subgroups examined, must be considered still preliminary. The results suggest that future research on the genetics of autism should carefully assess each of the major behavioral domains and seriously consider the possible role of modifying loci.

Using two decades of longitudinal data from a national survey, they demonstrate that not only does an individual’s race change over time, it changes in response to myriad changes in social position, and the patterns are similar for both self-identification and classification by others. These findings suggest that, in the contemporary United States, microlevel racial fluidity serves to reinforce existing disparities by redefining successful or high-status people as white (or not black) and unsuccessful or low-status people as black (or not white). Thus, racial differences are both an input and an output in stratification processes; this relationship has implications for theorizing and measuring race in research, as well as for crafting policies that attempt to address racialized inequality.},

	abstract = {Summary
Impaired regulation of the hypothalamusâ€“pituitaryâ€“adrenocortical ({HPA}) system is a consistent finding among patients with depression, which can be most sensitively detected with the combined dexamethasone (dex)/corticotrophin releasing hormone ({CRH}) test. The majority of patients with acute depression shows an exaggerated plasma corticotrophin ({ACTH}) and cortisol response to this test that normalizes gradually during successful antidepressant therapy. In contrast, persistently high {HPA}-responses to this challenge are prognostically less favorable. It has been recently questioned, whether this observation applies also to treatment with the atypical antidepressant mirtazapine, as patients treated with this drug showed a distinct attenuation of the endocrine response to the dex/{CRH} test already after 1 week of treatment.

In the present study, we investigated whether the attenuating effect of mirtazapine on the {HPA} system is an acute pharmacological reaction disappearing after physiological adaptation or whether this effect is related to the antidepressant action of the drug. We examined plasma {ACTH} and cortisol responses to the dex/{CRH} test in acutely depressed inpatients treated either with mirtazapine (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;55) or a monoamine reuptake inhibitor (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;105) according to doctorâ€™s choice and compared the test results with healthy controls (n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;40). Patients treated with monoamine reuptake inhibitors received either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRI}), tricyclic antidepressants ({TCA}) or the combined serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine.

We found increased plasma {ACTH} and cortisol responses to the dex/{CRH} test in depressed patients compared with healthy controls, but also significantly (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;.017) attenuated plasma cortisol secretion in the mirtazapine group compared to the group of monoamine reuptake inhibitor treated patients. This effect was not significant in male patients. Furthermore this effect was independent of the psychopathological state, but depended on treatment duration. Patient treatment with mirtazapine for up to 7 days resulted in dex/{CRH} test outcome that was indistinguishable from controls. This effect, however waned as it was not observable in patients treated for a longer period. These results suggest that short-term administration of mirtazapine has immediate but only transient suppressive effects on the {HPA} system predominantly in women. Our results confirm that dex/{CRH} tests can be used as predictors of clinical course also under mirtazapine treatment.},

However, the difficulties associated with subjective prior elicitation have prevented the widespread adoption of the Bayesian methodology by the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we present a Bayesian multilevel model for the analysis of brain {fMRI} data. The main idea is to consider that all the estimated group effects ({fMRI} activation patterns) are exchangeable. This means that all the collected voxel time series are considered manifestations of a few common underlying phenomena. In contradistinction to other Bayesian approaches, we think of the estimated activations as multivariate random draws from the same distribution without imposing specific prior spatial and/or temporal information for the interaction between voxels. Instead, a two-stage empirical Bayes prior approach is used to relate voxel regression equations through correlations between the regression coefficient vectors. The adaptive shrinkage properties of the Bayesian multilevel methodology are exploited to deal with spatial variations, and noise outliers. The characteristics of the proposed model are evaluated by considering its application to two real data sets.},

First, the age of participants studied (and labels for these age groups) is a critical design consideration. We suggest that it might be logical to reduce the reliance on convenience samples of undergraduates to represent adults in psychology and cognitive neuroscience studies, since there is substantial evidence that the brain is still developing within this age range. Second, developmental researchers are broadening their scope of inquiry by testing for non-linear effects, via increased use of longitudinal strategies or much wider age ranges and larger samples.

Six of the autistic group were shown to have iron deficiency anaemia and, of the 23 autistic children who had serum ferritin measured, 12 were iron deficient. Only two of the Asperger group had iron deficiency anaemia and, of the 22 children who had their serum ferritin measured, only three were iron deficient. Iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, can impair cognition and affect and is associated with developmental slowing in infants and mood changes and poor concentration in children. This study showed a very high prevalence of iron deficiency in children with autism, which could potentially compromise further their communication and behavioural impairments.},

Most economists were deeply skeptical--even antagonistic--toward the idea of importing insights from psychology into their field. Today, behavioral economics has become virtually mainstream. It is well represented in prominent journals and top economics departments, and behavioral economists, including several contributors to this volume, have garnered some of the most prestigious awards in the profession. This book assembles the most important papers on behavioral economics published since around 1990. Among the 25 articles are many that update and extend earlier foundational contributions, as well as cutting-edge papers that break new theoretical and empirical ground.  Advances in Behavioral Economics will serve as the definitive one-volume resource for those who want to familiarize themselves with the new field or keep up-to-date with the latest developments. It will not only be a core text for students, but will be consulted widely by professional economists, as well as psychologists and social scientists with an interest in how behavioral insights are being applied in economics.

To determine the brain regions that modulate facial emotion recognition, we conducted a whole-brain analysis using a well-validated facial emotion recognition task and voxel-based lesion symptom mapping ({VLSM}) in a large sample of patients with focal penetrating {TBIs} ({pTBIs}). Our results revealed that individuals with {pTBI} performed significantly worse than normal controls in recognizing unpleasant emotions. {VLSM} mapping results showed that impairment in facial emotion recognition was due to damage in a bilateral fronto-temporo-limbic network, including medial prefrontal cortex ({PFC}), anterior cingulate cortex, left insula and temporal areas. Beside those common areas, damage to the bilateral and anterior regions of {PFC} led to impairment in recognizing unpleasant emotions, whereas bilateral posterior {PFC} and left temporal areas led to impairment in recognizing pleasant emotions. Our findings add empirical evidence that the ability to read pleasant and unpleasant emotions in other people's faces is a complex process involving not only a common network that includes bilateral fronto-temporo-limbic lobes, but also other regions depending on emotional valence.},

	abstract = {Most analysis of multi-subject {fMRI} data is concerned with determining whether there exists a significant population-wide ‘activation’ in a comparison between two or more conditions. This is typically assessed by testing the average value of a contrast of parameter estimates ({COPE}) against zero in a general linear model ({GLM}) analysis. However, important information can also be obtained by testing whether there exist significant individual differences in effect magnitude between subjects, i.e. whether the variance of a {COPE} is significantly different from zero. Intuitively, such a test amounts to testing whether inter-individual differences are larger than would be expected given the within-subject error variance. We compare several methods for estimating variance components, including a) a naïve estimate using ordinary least squares ({OLS}); b) linear mixed effects in R ({LMER}); c) a novel Matlab implementation of iterative generalized least squares ({IGLS}) and its restricted maximum likelihood variant ({RIGLS}). All methods produced reasonable estimates of within- and between-subject variance components, with {IGLS} providing an attractive balance between sensitivity and appropriate control of false positives. Finally, we use the {IGLS} method to estimate inter-subject variance in a perfusion {fMRI} study (N = 18) of social evaluative threat, and show evidence for significant inter-individual differences in ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({VMPFC}), amygdala, hippocampus and medial temporal lobes, insula, and brainstem, with predicted inverse coupling between {VMPFC} and the midbrain periaqueductal gray only when high inter-individual variance was used to define the seed for functional connectivity analyses. In sum, tests of variance provides a way of selecting regions that show significant inter-individual variability for subsequent analyses that attempt to explain those individual differences.},

While the sets are clearly distinct from one another, they fall into the same general domain—that of constructs concerned with one's tendency to attend to psychological states, motives, and behavioral tendencies of the self and others. Two hundred and five high school students (103 males and 102 females) were surveyed at 1-year intervals for 3 successive years, completing the Self-Consciousness Scale and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (a measure of empathy) at each time point. Results indicated a considerable degree of year-to-year stability in scores on all three self-consciousness scales and all four empathy scales; in addition, for two of the self-consciousness scales (private and public) the degree of year-to-year stability increased with age. Mean scores on the three self-consciousness scales exhibited no significant change from year to year; for empathy, however, predicted year-to-year increases were found for perspective taking and empathic concern, and a predicted decrease over time was found for personal distress. These results are consistent with previous research and theorizing, and are discussed in terms of Hoffman's views on the development of empathic capacities in children.},

Children with {ASD} (9–14 years old; n = 14) were not affected by the gaze direction of facial stimuli. This finding was replicated in Experiment 2, which presented only the eye region of the face to typically developing children (n = 10) and children with {ASD} (n = 10).

We begin by describing the problem of misreporting in psychology and introduce the basic {AR} process. We then highlight both primary and secondary benefits of adopting {AR} and describe different permutations of the {AR} system, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. We conclude by attempting to dispel three anticipated concerns about {AR}: that it will increase the workload placed on scholars, that it will infringe on the traditional peer-review process, and that it will hurt the image of the discipline of psychology. Although implementing {AR} will add one more step to the bureaucratic publication process, we believe it can be implemented in an efficient manner that would greatly assist in decreasing the frequency and impact of misreporting while also providing secondary benefits in other domains of scientific integrity.},

Utilizing a psychological risk-return framework that regresses risk taking on the perceived benefits and perceived riskiness of an activity (Weber \& Milliman, 1997), this study examined the relations between risk attitude and broad personality dimensions using the new {HEXACO} personality framework (Lee \& Ashton, 2004) across four risk domains. This personality framework, which has been replicated in lexical studies in over 12 natural languages, assess personality over six broad personality dimensions, as opposed to the traditional Five-Factor Model, or “Big Five.” Through path analysis, we regressed risk taking in four separate domains on risk perceptions, perceived benefits, and the six {HEXACO} dimensions. Across all risk domains, we found that the emotionality dimension was associated with heightened risk perceptions and high conscientiousness was associated with less perceived benefits. We also report several unique patterns of domain-specific relations between the {HEXACO} dimensions and risk attitude. Specifically, openness was associated with risk taking and perceived benefits for social and recreational risks, whereas lower honesty/humility was associated with greater health/safety and ethical risk taking. These findings extend our understanding of how individuals approach risk across a variety of contexts, and further highlight the utility of honesty/humility, a dimension not recovered in Big Five models, in individual differences research.

We investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin treatment on the evaluation of explicit and “hidden” emotional expressions, and related the results to individual differences in sensitivity to others’ subtle expressions of anger and happiness. Forty healthy volunteers participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, which shows that a single dose of intranasal oxytocin (40IU) enhanced or “sharpened” evaluative processing of others’ positive and negative facial expression for both explicit and hidden emotional information. Our results point to mechanisms which could underpin oxytocin’s prosocial effects in humans. Importantly, individual differences in baseline emotional sensitivity predicted oxytocin’s effects on the ability to sense differences between faces with hidden emotional information. Participants with low emotional sensitivity showed greater oxytocin-induced improvement. These participants also showed larger task-related pupil dilation, suggesting that they also allocated the most attentional resources to the task. Overall, oxytocin treatment enhanced stimulus-induced pupil dilation, consistent with oxytocin enhancement of attention towards socially relevant stimuli. Since pupil dilation can be associated with increased attractiveness and approach behaviour, this effect could also represent a mechanism by which oxytocin increases human affiliation.},

Recent advances in computer science and data sharing make it possible to analyze large amounts of real {fMRI} data. In this study, 1484 rest datasets have been analyzed in {SPM}8, to estimate true familywise error rates. For a familywise significance threshold of 5\%, significant activity was found in 1\%–70\% of the 1484 rest datasets, depending on repetition time, paradigm and parameter settings. This means that parametric significance thresholds in {SPM} both can be conservative or very liberal. The main reason for the high familywise error rates seems to be that the global {AR}(1) auto correlation correction in {SPM} fails to model the spectra of the residuals, especially for short repetition times. The findings that are reported in this study cannot be generalized to parametric {fMRI} analysis in general, other software packages may give different results. By using the computational power of the graphics processing unit ({GPU}), the 1484 rest datasets were also analyzed with a random permutation test. Significant activity was then found in 1\%–19\% of the datasets. These findings speak to the need for a better model of temporal correlations in {fMRI} timeseries.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on social situations in which people are surprised about what is happening and inhibited about how to respond to the situation at hand. We study these situations by examining a classic topic in social psychology: how people respond to receiving better outcomes than are deserved. In these situations, the actions of an authority or a coworker push in the direction of accepting and enjoying the unfair outcome, whereas personal values for most people push in the direction of rejecting or being displeased with the outcome. This conflict may inhibit people's response to the advantageous but unfair outcomes. If people are indeed inhibited about how to respond to these kinds of outcomes, then lowering behavioral inhibition by reminding people of having acted in the past without inhibitions (in a manner that is unrelated to the outcomes participants subsequently receive) should affect reactions to the outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesize that because many people are prosocial and want to adhere to principles of fairness, reminders of behavioral disinhibition will lead to less pleasure with the unfairly obtained outcomes. The results of 8 experiments (conducted both inside and outside the psychology laboratory) revealed evidence for this benign disinhibition effect on various reactions to outcomes that are better than deserved. In further accordance with our line of reasoning, the effect is particularly pronounced among those who adhere to a prosocial orientation or who have adopted a prosocial mindset and is not observed among those with proself orientations or mindsets.},

	abstract = {People routinely make various trait judgments from facial appearance, and such judgments affect important social outcomes. These judgments are highly correlated with each other, reflecting the fact that valence evaluation permeates trait judgments from faces. Trustworthiness judgments best approximate this evaluation, consistent with evidence about the involvement of the amygdala in the implicit evaluation of face trustworthiness. Based on computer modeling and behavioral experiments, I argue that face evaluation is an extension of functionally adaptive systems for understanding the communicative meaning of emotional expressions. Specifically, in the absence of diagnostic emotional cues, trustworthiness judgments are an attempt to infer behavioral intentions signaling approach/avoidance behaviors. Correspondingly, these judgments are derived from facial features that resemble emotional expressions signaling such behaviors: happiness and anger for the positive and negative ends of the trustworthiness continuum, respectively. The emotion overgeneralization hypothesis can explain highly efficient but not necessarily accurate trait judgments from faces, a pattern that appears puzzling from an evolutionary point of view and also generates novel predictions about brain responses to faces. Specifically, this hypothesis predicts a nonlinear response in the amygdala to face trustworthiness, confirmed in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies, and dissociations between processing of facial identity and face evaluation, confirmed in studies with developmental prosopagnosics. I conclude with some methodological implications for the study of face evaluation, focusing on the advantages of formally modeling representation of faces on social dimensions.},

	abstract = {It is thought that the salivary cortisol awakening response can serve as a reliable marker of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical activity. Response magnitude might be influenced by stress, but results of studies on work-related stress have been inconclusive. Non-compliance with the sampling schedule is a potential confounding factor that has rarely been controlled. The objective of the study was to determine whether the cortisol awakening response is greater on a work day than on a weekend day, and whether responses vary with gender and socioeconomic position. Compliance was controlled by excluding participants who reported a delay of more than 10 min between waking up and taking the first saliva sample. Data were collected from 196 men and women aged 47 to 59 years drawn from the Whitehall {II} cohort of British civil servants, with free salivary cortisol sampled immediately after waking up and 30 min later on 2 days. Data on stress, perceived control and happiness over the remainder of the day, and on sleep quality, time of waking, and health behaviour were also obtained. The awakening response was lower in non-compliant participants than in compliant ones, so non-compliant participants were excluded from further analyses. Salivary cortisol levels on waking did not differ by gender or socioeconomic position, or between work and weekend days. However, the cortisol awakening response (defined as the difference between waking and 30 min later) was greater on work than weekend days (mean increases 10.5 and 3.7 nmol/l, P{\textless}0.001). On the work day, women showed larger increases than men (P=0.011), but there were no gender differences on the weekend day. Across both days, lower socioeconomic position was associated with a larger cortisol awakening response (P=0.014). Time of waking up was not related to the cortisol awakening response on either day. Participants rated themselves as more stressed, less in control, and less happy over the remainder of the work than weekend day. These results indicate that the cortisol awakening response occurs on both work and non-work days, but that anticipation of the working day is associated with an enhanced response. Cortisol output over the early part of the day may be particularly sensitive to the influence of chronic stress and its anticipation, especially in women.},

We review evidence that, across brain regions, neural responses to depictions of human behavior, from biological motion to trait descriptions, exhibit a key signature of predictive coding: reduced activity to predictable stimuli. We discuss how future experiments could distinguish predictive coding from alternative explanations of this response profile.

	abstract = {Anxiety is a polygenic condition, and the recently discovered Endocannabinoid System ({ECS}) is one plausible candidate. Experimental data suggest that the {ECS} can modulate several neurotransmitter systems, including the serotonergic system, which itself plays a significant role in anxiety. However, to date there is no evidence of gene-gene interactions; indeed genetic studies focusing separately on the two systems provide conflicting data. Thus, the aim of our study was to analyze the interaction of the promoter regions of the serotonin transporter ({SLC}6A4) and cannabinoid receptor 1 ({CNR}1) genes on anxiety. We genotyped 706 individuals for the 5-{HTTLPR} in the {SLC}6A4 promoter and 4 {SNPs} located in the {CNR}1 promoter region. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ({STAI}-S, {STAI}-T), the anxiety subscale of {TEMPS}-A ({TEMPS}-Anx), and the Brief Symptom Inventory ({BSI}-Anx). Significant 5-{HTTLPR} x {CNR}1 promoter-promoter interaction was observed using {STAI}-T (P = 0.0006) and {TEMPS}-Anx (P = 0.0013). The risk of high anxiety scores on {BSI}-Anx was 4.6-fold greater in homozygous '{GG}' rs2180619 in combination with homozygous '{SS}' 5-{HTTLPR} (P = 0.0005) compared to other genotypes. The effect of previously described "{TGC}" haplotype in the alternative promoter of {CNR}1 depended both on the conventional promoter polymorphism and the 5-{HTTLPR}. Our haplotype and putative transcription binding profile analyses strongly suggest that certain constellations of {CB}1-receptor and 5-{HTT} promoters yield extremely high or low synaptic 5-{HT} concentrations, and these are associated with an anxious phenotype. In conclusion, genetically determined serotonergic and endocannabinoid dysfunctions could lead to a vulnerability causing anxiety disorders and possibly depression.},

Compared with rest, imagination and execution showed overlapping networks, including bilateral premotor and parietal areas, basal ganglia and cerebellum.

The representative nature of sampling, and large samples sizes associated with population-based research offer high generalizability and power, and the ability to examine cortisol functioning in relation to: (a) a wide range of social environments; (b) a diverse array individuals and groups; and (c) a broad set of pre-disease and disease outcomes. The greater importance of high response rates (to maintain generalizability) and higher costs associated with this type of large-scale research, however, requires special adaptations of existing ambulatory cortisol protocols. These include: using the most efficient sample collection protocol possible that still adequately address the specific cortisol-related questions at hand, and ensuring the highest possible response and compliance rates among those individuals invited to participate. Examples of choices made, response rates obtained, and examples of results obtained from existing epidemiological cortisol studies are offered, as are suggestions for the modeling and interpretation of salivary cortisol data obtained in large-scale epidemiological research.},

	abstract = {The neural basis of social cognition has been the subject of intensive research in both human and non-human primates. Exciting, provocative and yet consistent findings are emerging. A major focus of interest is the role of efferent and afferent connectivity between the amygdala and the neocortical brain regions, now believed to be critical for the processing of social and emotional perceptions. One possible component is a subcortical neural pathway, which permits rapid and preconscious processing of potentially threatening stimuli, and it leads from the retina to the superior colliculus, to the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus and then to the amygdala. This pathway is activated by direct eye contact, one of many classes of potential threat, and may be particularly responsive to the ‘whites of the eyes’. In humans, autonomic arousal evoked by this stimulus is associated with the activity in specific cortical regions concerned with processing visual information from faces. The integrated functioning of these pathways is modulated by one or more X-linked genes, yet to be identified. The emotional responsiveness of the amygdala, and its associated circuits, to social threat is also influenced by functional polymorphisms in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene. We still do not have a clear account of how specific allelic variation, in candidate genes, increases susceptibility to developmental disorders, such as autism, or psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety or depressive illness. However, the regulation of emotional responsiveness to social cues lies at the heart of the problem, and recent research indicates that we may be nearing a deeper and more comprehensive understanding.},

	abstract = {Emotion regulation is a crucial skill in adulthood; its acquisition represents one of the key developmental tasks in early childhood. Difficulties with adaptive emotion regulation increase the risk of psychopathology in childhood and adulthood. This is, for instance, shown by a relation between emotion regulation and aggressive behavior in childhood age, indicating emotion dysregulation as an important risk factor of aggressive behavior and potential precursor of psychopathology. Based on (1) interrelations between emotion processes and social information processing (maladaptive emotion regulation and social information processing are associated with higher levels of aggression) and (2) recent neuroscientific findings showing that empathy deficits might not only result in difficulties labeling others' emotions but one's own emotions too, we suggest that empathy deficits might serve as potential trigger of emotion dysregulation. Different studies investigating the relation between empathy and emotion regulation are presented and discussed. Discussions are based on the assumed potential of empathy deficits triggering emotion dysregulation. Furthermore, developmental neuroscientific findings on empathy and emotion regulation are highlighted which provide further insights on how these processes might relate. Finally, possible directions for future research are presented.},

An integrated view of the issue of quality of life in patients with anxiety disorders can provide important information regarding the nature and extent of the burden associated with these disorders and may be useful in the development of strategies to deal with it.{METHOD}: A review of epidemiological and clinical studies that have investigated quality of life (broadly conceptualized) in patients with panic disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder was conducted by searching {MEDLINE} and {PsycLIT} citations from 1984 to 1999. A summary of the key articles published in this area is presented.{RESULTS}: The studies reviewed portray an almost uniform picture of anxiety disorders as illnesses that markedly compromise quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Significant impairment can also be found in individuals with subthreshold forms of anxiety disorders. Effective pharmacological or psychotherapeutic treatment has been shown to improve the quality of life for patients with panic disorder, social phobia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Limitations in current knowledge in this area are identified, and suggestions for needed future research are provided.{CONCLUSIONS}: It is expected that a more thorough understanding of the impact on quality of life will lead to increased public awareness of anxiety disorders as serious mental disorders worthy of further investment in research, prevention, and treatment.},

From this conceptual overview, a review of relevant theories is presented. Thereafter, a developmental perspective of peer interactions, relationships, and groups is presented covering the periods of infancy, toddlerhood, early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. Subsequently, methods and measures pertaining to the study of children's peer experiences are described. Next, we examine factors that may account for peer acceptance and rejection as well as qualitatively rich and poor friendships. Among the factors discussed are included temperament (biological factors), sex of child, parenting, parent-child relationships, and culture. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the extent to which individual differences in peer acceptance, rejection and friendship (prevalence and quality) predict adaptive and maladaptive developmental outcomes and a suggested agenda for future research.},

	abstract = {Korn and Whittemore1,2 have presented methods for analyzing longitudinal data where the number of observations per individual is large relative to the number of variables considered for each subject. However, this is often not the case in epidemiologic studies, since one usually collects data at relatively few time points, and the quantity of data collected for each individual at each time point is typically extensive. We present here an autoregressive model for analyzing longitudinal data of this type for the case of a continuous outcome variable. Some of the important features of this model are that one can (1) in the same analysis, consider both independent variables that are time-dependent and those that are fixed over time, (2) partially use data for an individual where some examinations are missing, (3) assess relationships between changes in outcome and exposure over short periods of time, (4) use ordinary multiple regression methods. Anderson3 has considered this type of model, but, to our knowledge, the model has never been applied to biostatistical problems. We illustrate these methods with data from a longitudinal study that seeks to identify the role of personal cigarette smoking on changes in pulmonary function in children.},

Sleep duration and quality were measured using actigraphs and the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Parents. Cognitive performance was measured using four subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children {III}, the Beery Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration ({VMI}), and the Narrative memory subtest of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment for Children. {RESULTS}: When adjusting for age, sex, and maternal education, shorter sleep duration, but not sleep quality, was associated with lower visuospatial abilities (p-values 0.043). Sleep duration and quality were not associated with verbal abilities (p-values0.18). With regard to the individual test results, shorter sleep duration was associated with worse performance in Visual-Motor Integration (p=0.028), and when excluding children with high depression scores the same was also true with Block Design (p-values0.047). Moreover, poor sleep efficiency was associated with worse performance in Similarities (p=0.004). {CONCLUSIONS}: In a community sample of 8-year-old children, those who slept less or had poorer sleep quality had lower test scores in cognitive tasks, particularly those pertaining to visuospatial performance, although the association was not very strong.},

	abstract = {The ability to self-correct is considered a hallmark of science. However, self-correction does not always happen to scientific evidence by default. The trajectory of scientific credibility can fluctuate over time, both for defined scientific fields and for science at-large. History suggests that major catastrophes in scientific credibility are unfortunately possible and the argument that “it is obvious that progress is made” is weak. Careful evaluation of the current status of credibility of various scientific fields is important in order to understand any credibility deficits and how one could obtain and establish more trustworthy results. Efficient and unbiased replication mechanisms are essential for maintaining high levels of scientific credibility. Depending on the types of results obtained in the discovery and replication phases, there are different paradigms of research: optimal, self-correcting, false nonreplication, and perpetuated fallacy. In the absence of replication efforts, one is left with unconfirmed (genuine) discoveries and unchallenged fallacies. In several fields of investigation, including many areas of psychological science, perpetuated and unchallenged fallacies may comprise the majority of the circulating evidence. I catalogue a number of impediments to self-correction that have been empirically studied in psychological science. Finally, I discuss some proposed solutions to promote sound replication practices enhancing the credibility of scientific results as well as some potential disadvantages of each of them. Any deviation from the principle that seeking the truth has priority over any other goals may be seriously damaging to the self-correcting functions of science.},

	abstract = {Anxiety and anxiety disorders are influenced by both, environmental and genetic factors. One genetic factor under scrutiny for anxiety disorders is the genetically encoded variation of the serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}). The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of a threatening environment during early phases of life on anxiety-like ({ANX}) and exploratory behavior ({EXP}) in adult mice, varying in serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) genotype. For this purpose, pregnant and lactating 5-{HTT} +/- dams were repeatedly exposed to olfactory cues of unfamiliar adult males by introducing small amounts of soiled bedding to their home cage. These stimuli signal the danger of infanticide and simulate a threatening environment. Control females were treated with neutral bedding. The offspring (5-{HTT} +/+, +/-, -/-) were examined for their {ANX} and {EXP}. The main results were: (1) a main effect of genotype existed, with 5-{HTT} -/- showing higher levels of {ANX} and lower levels of {EXP} than 5-{HTT} +/- and wildtypes. (2) When mothers had lived in a threatening environment, their offspring showed increased {ANX} and reduced {EXP} compared to controls. (3) These effects were most pronounced in 5-{HTT} -/- mice. By applying a new ecologically relevant paradigm we conclude: If 5-{HTT} +/- mothers live in a threatening environment during pregnancy and lactation, their offspring behavioral profile will, in principle, be shaped in an adaptive way preparing the young for an adverse environment. This process is, however, modulated by 5-{HTT} genotype, bearing the risk that individuals with impaired serotonergic neurotransmission (5-{HTT} -/-) will develop an exaggerated, potentially pathological level of anxiety from gene x environment interactions.},

	abstract = {Children exposed to early parental loss from death or separation carry a greater risk for developing future psychiatric illnesses, such as major depression and anxiety. Monkeys experiencing maternal separation at 1 week of age show fewer social behaviors and an increase in self-comforting behaviors (e.g., thumb sucking) over development, whereas in contrast, monkeys experiencing maternal separation at 1 month of age show increased seeking of social comfort later in life. We sought to identify neural systems that may underlie these stress-induced behavioral changes by examining changes in {mRNA} content in amygdala tissue collected from 1 week separated, 1 month separated, and maternally reared infants at 3 months of age. {mRNA} from the right medial temporal lobe, primarily the amygdala, was analyzed using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 arrays. One gene, guanylate cyclase 1 α 3 ({GUCY}1A3), showed differential expression between the 1 week and maternally reared groups and the 1 week and 1 month groups; these changes were confirmed by in situ hybridization. The expression of this gene was positively correlated with acute social-comforting behavior (r = 0.923; p = 0.001) and longer-term close social behavior (r = 0.708; p = 0.015) and negatively correlated with self-comforting behaviors (r = −0.88; p {\textless} 0.001). Additional in situ hybridization studies of {GUCY}1A3 in normal monkeys showed that this gene is expressed at adult levels by 1 week of age and that its expression is greater in the amygdala than all other brain areas examined. We conclude that {GUCY}1A3 may contribute to the altered behavioral phenotypes that are differentially displayed depending on the age at which macaque infants experience an early-life stress.},

The relation between status and other social behaviors such as aggression was predicted to be mediated by the degree of similarity between the individual and the peer group. Two studies were conducted with 217 males (mean age 10 yrs) at a summer program for children with behavioral and social problems. Data from both acceptance and rejection measures of status support the proposed model.

American Grace is an authoritative, fascinating examination of what precipitated these changes and the role that religion plays in contemporary American society. Although there is growing polarization between religious conservatives and secular liberals today, at the same time personal interfaith ties are strengthening. Interfaith marriage has increased, and religious identities have become more fluid. More people than ever are friendly with someone of a different faith or no faith at all. Putnam and Campbell show how this denser web of personal ties brings greater interfaith tolerance, despite the so-called culture wars. Based on two of the most comprehensive surveys ever conducted on religion and public life in America (and with a new epilogue based on a third survey), American Grace is an indispensable book about American religious life, essential for understanding our nation today.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}) are a complex group of neurodevelopmental disorders encompassing impairments in communication, social interactions and restricted stereotypical behaviors. Although a link between altered immune responses and {ASD} was first recognized nearly 40years ago, only recently has new evidence started to shed light on the complex multifaceted relationship between immune dysfunction and behavior in {ASD}. Neurobiological research in {ASD} has highlighted pathways involved in neural development, synapse plasticity, structural brain abnormalities, cognition and behavior. At the same time, several lines of evidence point to altered immune dysfunction in {ASD} that directly impacts some or all these neurological processes. Extensive alterations in immune function have now been described in both children and adults with {ASD}, including ongoing inflammation in brain specimens, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in the {CSF} and blood, increased presence of brain-specific auto-antibodies and altered immune cell function. Furthermore, these dysfunctional immune responses are associated with increased impairments in behaviors characteristic of core features of {ASD}, in particular, deficits in social interactions and communication. This accumulating evidence suggests that immune processes play a key role in the pathophysiology of {ASD}. This review will discuss the current state of our knowledge of immune dysfunction in {ASD}, how these findings may impact on underlying neuro-immune mechanisms and implicate potential areas where the manipulation of the immune response could have an impact on behavior and immunity in {ASD}.},

It is argued that the theoretical and empirical value of the proposed measure is justification for abandoning the Katz and Braly measure. Theoretically, the new measure relates stereotype research to attribution theory as part of a Bayesian approach to the psychology of prediction. Empirically, the new measure opens interesting questions about stereotypes, especially about stereotype validity and the "kernel of truth" hypothesis. A study using the new measure revealed that diverse groups of Ss (N = 75) had some similar stereotypes of Black Americans, that these stereotypes were relatively accurate, and that contrary to the "kernel of truth" hypothesis, these stereotypes were seldom exaggerated.

In this study, to examine the clinical pharmacotherapeutic effects on {HPA} axis function and brain metabolism in {MDD} patients, we performed the combined dexamethasone ({DEX})/corticotropin-releasing hormone ({CRH}) test on 24 antidepressant-free patients with {MDD} a few days after positron emission tomography ({PET}) with a radiotracer, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG}). Moreover, 10 patients who responded to pharmacotherapy were re-tested. 75\% of unmedicated {MDD} patients exhibited a heightened cortisol response to the {DEX}/{CRH} test, and thus were defined as non-suppressors. Non-suppressors showed a marked hypometabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex as compared with suppressors. After successful pharmacotherapy, enhanced cortisol responsiveness normalized. Prior to treatment of the unmedicated {MDD}, a significant hypometabolism in various frontal regions and a significant hypermetabolism in the right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were observed compared with controls. Metabolic activity in treatment responders showed a normalizing pattern in almost all the areas that had been characterized by metabolic abnormality at baseline except for the medial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that depressed patients remitted with antidepressant treatment were accompanied by resolution of {HPA} dysregulation and alteration of regional glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortical, limbic and paralimbic regions.},

Because reappraisal is thought to be supported by linearly developing prefrontal regions, one prediction is that reappraisal ability develops linearly. However, recent investigations into socio-emotional development suggest that there are non-linear patterns that uniquely affect adolescents. We compared older children (10–13), adolescents (14–17) and young adults (18–22) on a task that distinguishes negative emotional reactivity from reappraisal ability. Behaviorally, we observed no age differences in self-reported emotional reactivity, but linear and quadratic relationships between reappraisal ability and age. Neurally, we observed linear age-related increases in activation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, previously identified in adult reappraisal. We observed a quadratic pattern of activation with age in regions associated with social cognitive processes like mental state attribution (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal cortex). In these regions, we observed relatively lower reactivity-related activation in adolescents, but higher reappraisal-related activation. This suggests that (i) engagement of the cognitive control components of reappraisal increases linearly with age and (ii) adolescents may not normally recruit regions associated with mental state attribution, but (iii) this can be reversed with reappraisal instructions.},

One consequence is that there is hardly ever an articulated and understood framework for the units of the measures that are employed. Without meaningful measurement units, theoretical formulations are limited to statements of the direction of an effect or association, or to effects expressed in standardized units. Thus the long term scientific goal of generation of laws expressing the relationships among variables in scale units is greatly hindered. This article reviews alternative methods of scoring a scale. Two recent journal volumes are surveyed with regard to current scoring practices. Alternative methods of scoring are evaluated against seven articulated criteria representing the information conveyed by each in an illustrative example. Converting scores to the percent of maximum possible score ({POMP}) is shown to provide useful additional information in many cases.},

	abstract = {Social dominance theory ({SDT}) is a theory of intergroup relations that focuses on the maintenance and stability of group-based social hierarchies.[1] According to the theory, group-based inequalities are maintained through three primary intergroup behaviors—specifically: institutional discrimination, aggregated individual discrimination, and behavioral asymmetry. {SDT} proposes that widely shared cultural ideologies (i.e., legitimizing myths) provide the moral and intellectual justification for these intergroup behaviors. There are two functional types of legitimizing myths: (1) hierarchy-enhancing and (2) hierarchy-attenuating legitimizing myths. Hierarchy-enhancing ideologies (e.g., racism and nationalism) contribute to greater levels of group-based inequality. Hierarchy-attenuating ideologies (e.g., anarchism and feminism) contribute to greater levels of group-based equality. People endorse these different forms of ideologies based in part on their psychological orientation toward dominance and their desire for unequal group relations (i.e., their social dominance orientation; {SDO}). People who are higher on {SDO} tend to endorse hierarchy-enhancing ideologies, and people who are lower on {SDO} tend to endorse hierarchy-attenuating ideologies. {SDT} finally proposes that the relative counterbalancing of hierarchy-enhancing and -attenuating social forces stabilizes group-based inequality.},

	abstract = {Action observation leads to the automatic activation of the corresponding motor representation in the observer through “mirror-matching.” This constitutes a “shared representational system,” which is thought to subserve social understanding by motor simulation. However, it is unclear how these shared representations can be controlled and distinguished. Brain imaging suggests that controlling shared representations, indexed by the ability to control automatic imitative responses, activates anterior fronto-median cortex ({aFMC}), and temporo-parietal junction ({TPJ}). Crucially, these regions are also consistently implicated in mental state attribution and have provided an alternative account for higher-level social cognition. Here, we directly tested whether social-cognitive processes involve similar key computational mechanisms as the control of shared representations by using functional brain imaging to reveal overlapping brain circuits. We show in a within-subject design that commonly activated regions occurred selectively in {aFMC} and {TPJ}. Mentalizing and self-referential thoughts recruited a region in {aFMC}, which was also activated when controlling imitation. In the {TPJ}, an area overlapped between mentalizing, agency processing, and imitative control. Behavioral and neural correlates of mentalizing were further related to the individual ability for controlling imitation. Our findings support the assumption of shared key processes and suggest a novel link between embodied and social cognition. Hum Brain Mapp, 2009. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Single subject {fMRI} has proved to be a useful tool for mapping functional areas in clinical procedures such as tumor resection. Using {fMRI} data, clinicians assess the risk, plan and execute such procedures based on thresholded statistical maps. However, because current thresholding methods were developed mainly in the context of cognitive neuroscience group studies, most single subject {fMRI} maps are thresholded manually to satisfy specific criteria related to single subject analyzes. Here, we propose a new adaptive thresholding method which combines Gamma-Gaussian mixture modeling with topological thresholding to improve cluster delineation. In a series of simulations we show that by adapting to the signal and noise properties, the new method performs well in terms of total number of errors but also in terms of the trade-off between false negative and positive cluster error rates. Similarly, simulations show that adaptive thresholding performs better than fixed thresholding in terms of over and underestimation of the true activation border (i.e., higher spatial accuracy). Finally, through simulations and a motor test–retest study on 10 volunteer subjects, we show that adaptive thresholding improves reliability, mainly by accounting for the global signal variance. This in turn increases the likelihood that the true activation pattern can be determined offering an automatic yet flexible way to threshold single subject {fMRI} maps.},

	abstract = {The left superior temporal cortex shows greater responsiveness to speech than to non-speech sounds according to previous neuroimaging studies, suggesting that this brain region has a special role in speech processing. However, since speech sounds differ acoustically from the non-speech sounds, it is possible that this region is not involved in speech perception per se, but rather in processing of some complex acoustic features. “Sine wave speech” ({SWS}) provides a tool to study neural speech specificity using identical acoustic stimuli, which can be perceived either as speech or non-speech, depending on previous experience of the stimuli. We scanned 21 subjects using 3T functional {MRI} in two sessions, both including {SWS} and control stimuli. In the pre-training session, all subjects perceived the {SWS} stimuli as non-speech. In the post-training session, the identical stimuli were perceived as speech by 16 subjects. In these subjects, {SWS} stimuli elicited significantly stronger activity within the left posterior superior temporal sulcus ({STSp}) in the post- vs. pre-training session. In contrast, activity in this region was not enhanced after training in 5 subjects who did not perceive {SWS} stimuli as speech. Moreover, the control stimuli, which were always perceived as non-speech, elicited similar activity in this region in both sessions. Altogether, the present findings suggest that activation of the neural speech representations in the left {STSp} might be a pre-requisite for hearing sounds as speech.},

Previous human imaging studies focusing on empathy for others' pain have consistently shown activations in regions also involved in the direct pain experience, particularly anterior insula and anterior and midcingulate cortex. These findings suggest that empathy is, in part, based on shared representations for firsthand and vicarious experiences of affective states. Empathic responses are not static but can be modulated by person characteristics, such as degree of alexithymia. It has also been shown that contextual appraisal, including perceived fairness or group membership of others, may modulate empathic neuronal activations. Empathy often involves coactivations in further networks associated with social cognition, depending on the specific situation and information available in the environment. Empathy-related insular and cingulate activity may reflect domain-general computations representing and predicting feeling states in self and others, likely guiding adaptive homeostatic responses and goal-directed behavior in dynamic social contexts.},

In this paper, we review this rapidly expanding area of neuroscience and describe models of neurocognitive development that have emerged recently. One implication of these models is that neural development underlies commonly observed adolescent phenomena such as susceptibility to peer influence and sensitivity to peer rejection. Experimental behavioural evidence of rejection sensitivity in adolescence is currently sparse. Here, we describe a study that directly compared the affective consequences of an experimental ostracism manipulation (Cyberball) in female adolescents and adults. The ostracism condition led to significantly greater affective consequences in the adolescents compared with adults. This suggests that the ability to regulate distress resulting from ostracism continues to develop between adolescence and adulthood.

	abstract = {{AbstractRationale}  Genotype at the 5′ promoter region (5-{HTTLPR}) of the serotonin transporter has been implicated in moderating the effects of acute tryptophan depletion on neurocognitive functioning. Acute tryptophan depletion has been associated with the processing of fear-relevant cues, such as emotional expressions, but the effect of genotype at the 5-{HTTLPR} has not been assessed.Objective  The present study investigated the effects of acute tryptophan depletion on the recognition of standardized facial expressions of emotions in healthy volunteers classified as ll homozygotes or s carriers.Materials and methods  A double-blind between-groups design was used with volunteers randomly selected to ingest capsules containing an amino acid mixture specifically lacking tryptophan, or placebo capsules containing lactose. 5 h after capsule ingestion, subjects were required to identify anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise expressions that progressed from neutral to each full emotional expression in 5\% steps.Results  Tryptophan depletion significantly impaired the recognition of fearful facial expressions in s carriers but not ll homozygotes. This impairment was specific to fear expressions. No significant differences in the recognition of other expressions were found. Free tryptophan levels were correlated with fear recognition in s carriers but not ll homozygotes.Conclusions  The effects of acute tryptophan depletion on the processing of emotional expressions varies as a function of genotype at the 5-{HTTLPR}. Depletion impairs the recognition of fear in s carriers but not ll homozygotes. This finding reinforces the importance of considering genotype when assessing the behavioral effects of pharmacologic modulation.},

Such tasks explored attention, short-term memory spans, learning abilities, planning and programming capacities, categorizing activities and verbal fluency. Patients were found to have a significantly decreased ability to initiate new mental processes and to inhibit automatic ones, in conjunction with a tendency for preservative errors. They were also affected with deficits of verbal and visual learning abilities and had reduced memory spans. Such defects were further evaluated via logistic regression against two criteria of the severity of the disease: the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep and the level of nocturnal hypoxemia. Memory deficits were rather related to the former, whereas typical frontal lobe-related abnormalities seemed rather consistent with the latter. These findings are discussed in light of data from the literature concerning cognitive impairments described for patients with isolated daytime sleepiness versus hypoxemia, as illustrated in other pathological or physiological circumstances.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
Affective biases may underlie many of the key symptoms of major depressive disorder, from anhedonia to altered cognitive performance. Understanding the cause of these biases is therefore critical in the quest for improved treatments. Depression is associated, for example, with a negative affective bias in reversal learning. However, despite the fact that reversal learning is associated with striatal response in healthy individuals and depressed individuals exhibit attenuated striatal function on multiple tasks, studies to date have not demonstrated striatal involvement in the negative bias in reversal learning in depression. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether this may be because reversal learning tasks conventionally used to study behavior examine reversals only on the basis of unexpected punishment and therefore do not adequately separate reward- and punishment-based behavior.Method:
The authors used functional {MRI} to compare the hemodynamic response to a reversal learning task with mixed reward- and punishment-based reversal stages between individuals with unmedicated major depressive disorder (N=13) and healthy comparison subjects (N=14).Results:
Impaired reward (but not punishment) reversal accuracy was found alongside attenuated anteroventral striatal response to unexpected reward in depression.Conclusions:
Attenuated neurophysiological response of the anteroventral striatum may reflect dysfunction in circuits involving afferent projections from the orbitofrontal, limbic, and/or mesostriatal dopaminergic pathways, which conceivably may, together with the ventral striatum, underlie anhedonia in depression. Learning to appreciate and enjoy positive life experiences is critical for recovery from depression. This study pinpoints a neural target for such recovery.Abstract Teaser},

Children watched photographs of caregiver and stranger faces while event-related potentials were recorded. Results demonstrate that institutionalized children show pervasive cortical hypoarousal in response to faces and that foster care is somewhat effective in remediating this deficit by 42 months of age. All 3 groups of children distinguished between the familiar and unfamiliar faces.

We first identify the regions within the {LFPN} that are most strongly linked to relational thinking, and show that stronger communication between these regions over the course of development supports improvements in relational reasoning. We then explore differences in the {LFPN} between humans and other primate species that could explain species differences in the capacity for relational reasoning. We conclude that fairly small neuroanatomical changes in specific regions of the {LFPN} and their connections have led to big ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in cognition.},

In healthy individuals, affective perspective taking has proven to be an effective means to elicit empathy and concern for others. To examine neural responses in individuals who vary in psychopathy during affective perspective taking, 121 incarcerated males, classified as high (n = 37; Hare psychopathy checklist-revised, {PCL}-R ≥ 30), intermediate (n = 44; {PCL}-R between 21 and 29), and low (n = 40; {PCL}-R ≤ 20) psychopaths, were scanned while viewing stimuli depicting bodily injuries and adopting an imagine-self and an imagine-other perspective. During the imagine-self perspective, participants with high psychopathy showed a typical response within the network involved in empathy for pain, including the anterior insula ({aINS}), anterior midcingulate cortex ({aMCC}), supplementary motor area ({SMA}), inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}), somatosensory cortex, and right amygdala. Conversely, during the imagine-other perspective, psychopaths exhibited an atypical pattern of brain activation and effective connectivity seeded in the anterior insula and amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}). The response in the amygdala and insula was inversely correlated with {PCL}-R Factor 1 (interpersonal/affective) during the imagine-other perspective. In high psychopaths, scores on {PCL}-R Factor 1 predicted the neural response in ventral striatum when imagining others in pain. These patterns of brain activation and effective connectivity associated with differential perspective-taking provide a better understanding of empathy dysfunction in psychopathy, and have the potential to inform intervention programs for this complex clinical problem.},

Could such enhanced selection for association arise early enough to facilitate low-level visual processing? In a test of this possibility, adult volunteers first engaged in a value-learning task involving faces that were differentially predictive of monetary wins or losses. Later, in a simple recognition task, these faces were briefly presented for a variable duration and then masked. The critical presentation duration needed to produce criterion-level recognition was measured to index the visual processing speed for each learned face. Critical duration was significantly shorter for stimuli with high learned predictiveness than for stimuli with low learned predictiveness, regardless of whether they were associated with wins or losses. These results show that neural mechanisms involved in predicting future outcomes are able to modulate visual processing efficiency, probably via cortical feedback processes.},

Although we found their discussion of different processes that have been labeled empathy interesting and helpful, we found their discussion of self–other overlap to be somewhat less useful for conceptualizing differences among empathy-related processes.

	abstract = {Cooperation is central to human social behaviour. However, choosing to cooperate requires individuals to incur a personal cost to benefit others. Here we explore the cognitive basis of cooperative decision-making in humans using a dual-process framework. We ask whether people are predisposed towards selfishness, behaving cooperatively only through active self-control; or whether they are intuitively cooperative, with reflection and prospective reasoning favouring /`rational/' self-interest. To investigate this issue, we perform ten studies using economic games. We find that across a range of experimental designs, subjects who reach their decisions more quickly are more cooperative. Furthermore, forcing subjects to decide quickly increases contributions, whereas instructing them to reflect and forcing them to decide slowly decreases contributions. Finally, an induction that primes subjects to trust their intuitions increases contributions compared with an induction that promotes greater reflection. To explain these results, we propose that cooperation is intuitive because cooperative heuristics are developed in daily life where cooperation is typically advantageous. We then validate predictions generated by this proposed mechanism. Our results provide convergent evidence that intuition supports cooperation in social dilemmas, and that reflection can undermine these cooperative impulses.},

	shorttitle = {What is known about autism},
	abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of genetic origins, with a heritability of about 90\%. Autistic disorder is classed within the broad domain of pervasive developmental disorders ({PDD}) that also includes Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger syndrome, and {PDD} not otherwise specified ({PDD}-{NOS}). Prevalence estimates suggest a rate of 0.1-0.2\% for autism and 0.6\% for the range of {PDD} disorders. There is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity within this class of disorders as well as continued debate regarding their clinical boundaries. Autism is the prototypical {PDD}, and is characterized by impairments in three core domains: social interaction, language development, and patterns of behavior (restricted and stereotyped). Clinical pattern and severity of impairment vary along these dimensions, and the level of cognitive functioning of individuals with autism spans the entire range, from profound mental retardation to superior intellect. There is no single biological or clinical marker for autism, nor is it expected that a single gene is responsible for its expression; as many as 15+ genes may be involved. However, environmental influences are also important, as concordance in monozygotic twins is less than 100\% and the phenotypic expression of the disorder varies widely, even within monozygotic twins. Multiple susceptibility factors are being explored using varied methodologies, including genome-wide linkage studies, and family- and case-control candidate gene association studies. This paper reviews what is currently known about the genetic and environmental risk factors, neuropathology, and psychopharmacology of autism. Discussion of genetic factors focuses on the findings from linkage and association studies, the results of which have implicated the involvement of nearly every chromosome in the human genome. However, the most consistently replicated linkage findings have been on chromosome 7q, 2q, and 15q. The positive associations from candidate gene studies are largely unreplicated, with the possible exceptions of the {GABRB}3 and serotonin transporter genes. No single region of the brain or pathophysiological mechanism has yet been identified as being associated with autism. Postmortem findings, animal models, and neuroimaging studies have focused on the cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and especially the amygdala. The cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit may also be influential in autism. There is evidence that overall brain size is increased in some individuals with autism. Presently there are no drugs that produce major improvements in the core social or pragmatic language deficits in autism, although several have limited effects on associated behavioral features. The application of new techniques in autism research is being proposed, including the investigation of abnormal regulation of gene expression, proteomics, and the use of {MRI} and postmortem analysis of the brain.},

The oldest patient group had higher mean post-dexamethasone plasma cortisol concentrations both before and after treatment, and more were {DST} nonsuppressors. Life table analyses revealed that elderly patients who were {DST} nonsuppressors had significantly slower patterns of normalization during treatment and that fewer elderly patients ever achieved normal suppression.

We tested for cross-national effect differences in representative samples of seven European countries. Results turned out to be relatively robust across countries. We found that church attendance, dogmatic conviction and a consequential religious attitude affect intentional donations positively. The religiosity of one's network does have an additional effect. Partner's church attendance is positively related to willingness to donate. However, people with mainly friends with the same religious opinions are less willing to donate.},

	abstract = {Self-recognition has been demonstrated by a select number of primate species and is often used as an index of self-awareness. Whether a specialized neural mechanism for self-face recognition in humans exists remains unclear. We used event-related {fMRI} to investigate brain regions selectively activated by images of one's own face. Ten right-handed normal subjects viewed digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched familiar other presented in a random sequence. Subjects were instructed to press a button with the right hand if the image looked like their own face, and another button if it looked like a familiar or scrambled face. Contrasting the trials in which images contain more “self” with those containing more familiar “other” revealed signal changes in the right hemisphere ({RH}) including the inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus. The opposite contrast revealed voxels with higher signal intensity for images of “other” than for “self” in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Additional contrasts against baseline revealed that activity in the “self” minus “other” contrasts represent signal increases compared to baseline (null events) in “self” trials, while activity in the “other” minus “self” contrasts represent deactivations relative to baseline during “self” trials. Thus, a unique network involving frontoparietal structures described as part of the “mirror neuron system” in the {RH} underlies self-face recognition, while regions comprising the “default/resting state” network deactivate less for familiar others. We provide a model that reconciles these findings and previously published work to account for the modulations in these two networks previously implicated in social cognition.},

This review will consider recent and emerging findings implicating sleep and specific sleep-stage physiologies in the modulation, regulation, and even preparation of cognitive and emotional brain processes. First, evidence for the role of sleep in memory processing will be discussed, principally focusing on declarative memory. Second, at a neural level several mechanistic models of sleep-dependent plasticity underlying these effects will be reviewed, with a synthesis of these features offered that may explain the ordered structure of sleep, and the orderly evolution of memory stages. Third, accumulating evidence for the role of sleep in associative memory processing will be discussed, suggesting that the long-term goal of sleep may not be the strengthening of individual memory items, but, instead, their abstracted assimilation into a schema of generalized knowledge. Fourth, the newly emerging benefit of sleep in regulating emotional brain reactivity will be considered. Finally, and building on this latter topic, a novel hypothesis and framework of sleep-dependent affective brain processing will be proposed, culminating in testable predictions and translational implications for mood disorders.},

In such a view, a construct like ’depression’ is not seen as a latent variable that underlies symptoms like ’lack of sleep’ or ’fatigue’, and neither as a composite constructed out of these symptoms, but as a system of causal relations between the symptoms themselves (e.g., lack of sleep → fatigue, etc.).

Based on the Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures guidelines, the cognitive-behavioral therapy ({CBT}) based specific programs of Penn Prevention Program, Self-Control Therapy, and Coping with Depression-Adolescent are probably efficacious. Interpersonal Therapy-Adolescent, which falls under the theoretical category of interpersonal therapy ({IPT}), also is a probably efficacious treatment. {CBT} provided through the modalities of child group only and child group plus parent components are well-established intervention approaches for depressed children. For adolescents, two modalities are well-established ({CBT} adolescent only group, {IPT} individual), and three are probably efficacious ({CBT} adolescent group plus parent component, {CBT} individual, {CBT} individual plus parent/family component). From the broad theoretical level, {CBT} has well-established efficacy and behavior therapy meets criteria for a probably efficacious intervention for childhood depression. For adolescent depression, both {CBT} and {IPT} have well-established efficacy. Future research directions and best practices are offered.},

	abstract = {Brain plasticity as a neurobiological reflection of individuality is difficult to capture in animal models. Inspired by behavioral-genetic investigations of human monozygotic twins reared together, we obtained dense longitudinal activity data on 40 inbred mice living in one large enriched environment. The exploratory activity of the mice diverged over time, resulting in increasing individual differences with advancing age. Individual differences in cumulative roaming entropy, indicating the active coverage of territory, correlated positively with individual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Our results show that factors unfolding or emerging during development contribute to individual differences in structural brain plasticity and behavior. The paradigm introduced here serves as an animal model for identifying mechanisms of plasticity underlying nonshared environmental contributions to individual differences in behavior.
Identical and Still Different
Even in monozygotic twins reared together, there are always observable differences reflecting the influence of individual responses. Freund et al. (p. 756; see the Perspective by Bergmann and Frisén) developed an inbred mouse model for studying the environmental influences on genetically identical animals and examined their effects on behavioral and neural development.},

We suggest that if a unitary mirror neuron system mediates the observation and production of both language and non-linguistic action, three prediction can be made: (1) damage to the human mirror neuron system should non-selectively disrupt both sign language and non-linguistic action processing; (2) within the domain of sign language, a given mirror neuron locus should mediate both perception and production; and (3) the action-based tuning curves of individual mirror neurons should support the highly circumscribed set of motions that form the “vocabulary of action” for signed languages.

These are just a few examples of the many questions about consciousness that are troubling scientists and laypersons alike. Moreover, these questions share a striking feature: They seem to have been around forever, yet neither science nor philosophy has been able to provide an answer. Why is that? In my view, the main reason is that the study of consciousness is dominated by what we know from introspection and behavior. This has fooled us into thinking that we know what we are conscious of. The scientific equivalent of this is Global Workspace theory. But in fact we don't know what we are conscious of, as I will explain from a simple experiment in visual perception. Once we acknowledge that, it is clear that we need other evidence about the presence or absence of a conscious sensation than introspection or behavior. Assuming the brain has something to do with it, I will demonstrate how arguments from neuroscience, together with theoretical and ontological arguments, can help us resolve what the exact nature of our conscious sensation is. It turns out that we see much more than we think, and that Global Workspace theory is all about access but not about seeing. The exercise is an example of how neuroscience will move us away from psychological intuitions about consciousness, and hence depict a notion of consciousness that may go against our deepest conviction: “My consciousness is mine, and mine alone.” It's not.},

Intense and frequent negative affect during this period has been hypothesized to explain the increased rates of affective disorders, suicide, and accidental death during this time of life. Yet some teens emerge from adolescence with minimal turmoil. We provide a neurobiological model of adolescence that proposes an imbalance in the development of subcortical limbic (e.g., amygdala) relative to prefrontal cortical regions as a potential mechanism for heightened emotionality during this period. Empirical support for this model is provided from recent behavioral and human imaging studies on the development of emotion regulation. We then provide examples of environmental factors that may exacerbate imbalances in amygdala-ventrofrontal function increasing risk for anxiety related behaviors. Finally we present data from human and mouse studies to illustrate how genetic factors may enhance or diminish this risk. Together, these studies provide a converging methods approach for understanding the highly variable stress and turmoil experienced in adolescence. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The utility of mediation analysis stems from its ability to go beyond the merely descriptive to a more functional understanding of the relationships among variables. A necessary component of mediation is a statistically and practically significant indirect effect. Although mediation hypotheses are frequently explored in psychological research, formal significance tests of indirect effects are rarely conducted. After a brief overview of mediation, we argue the importance of directly testing the significance of indirect effects and provide {SPSS} and {SAS} macros that facilitate estimation of the indirect effect with a normal theory approach and a bootstrap approach to obtaining confidence intervals, as well as the traditional approach advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986). We hope that this discussion and the macros will enhance the frequency of formal mediation tests in the psychology literature.

This relation was largely due to the Straightforwardness and Modesty facets of {FFM} Agreeableness, which were only weakly correlated with the Big Five version of Agreeableness. A realignment of {FFM} facets to produce separate Honesty-Humility and Agreeableness factors provided better prediction of personality variables that involve deceit without hostility, such as Social Adroitness and Self-Monitoring.

	abstract = {Social scientists have traditionally argued that whiteness—the attribute of being recognized and treated as a White person in society—is powerful because it is invisible. On this view, members of the racially dominant group have the unique luxury of rarely noticing their race or the privileges it confers. This article challenges this “invisibility thesis,” arguing that Whites frequently regard themselves as racial actors. We further argue that whiteness defines a problematic social identity that confronts Whites with 2 psychological threats: the possibility that their accomplishments in life were not fully earned (meritocratic threat) and the association with a group that benefits from unfair social advantages (group-image threat). We theorize that Whites manage their racial identity to dispel these threats. According to our deny, distance, or dismantle (3D) model of White identity management, dominant-group members have three strategies at their disposal: deny the existence of privilege, distance their own self-concepts from the White category, or strive to dismantle systems of privilege. Whereas denial and distancing promote insensitivity and inaction with respect to racial inequality, dismantling reduces threat by relinquishing privileges. We suggest that interventions aimed at reducing inequality should attempt to leverage dismantling as a strategy of White identity management.},

Even more compellingly, the lifetime prevalence rate of depression in the {US} has recently been estimated to include 16.2\% of adults (21\% women, 13\% men), or {\textgreater}32.6 million people. There are multiple putative "causes" of depression, with approximately one-third of an individual's propensity for unipolar depression due to genetic vulnerability, while the remaining two-thirds is due to environmental factors. Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ({SSRI}) antidepressants are believed to mainly act by selectively binding to the serotonin (5-{HT}) transporter to block reuptake of 5-{HT} from the synapse into the presynaptic nerve terminal, thereby increasing synaptic serotonin concentrations, some of the {SSRIs} also exhibit other neuropharmacologic effects. One such example is the high affinity for paroxetine in blocking norepinephrine reuptake. Another is the inhibition of dopamine reuptake by sertraline. In depression, hyperactivity of corticotropin-releasing factor ({CRF})--producing neurons contribute to the well-characterized hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity of depression. Increased activity of extrahypothalamic {CRF} circuits are believed to contribute to several depressive symptoms. Treatment and certain {SSRIs} have been shown to reduce the activity of {CRF} neurons and may contribute to their therapeutic action. Each {SSRI} apparently has its own unique pharmacologic properties that likely underlie their observed differences in clinical use.},

In Study 1 with 373 7th graders, the belief that intelligence is malleable (incremental theory) predicted an upward trajectory in grades over the two years of junior high school, while a belief that intelligence is fixed (entity theory) predicted a flat trajectory. A mediational model including learning goals, positive beliefs about effort, and causal attributions and strategies was tested. In Study 2, an intervention teaching an incremental theory to 7th graders (N=48) promoted positive change in classroom motivation, compared with a control group (N=43). Simultaneously, students in the control group displayed a continuing downward trajectory in grades, while this decline was reversed for students in the experimental group.},

	abstract = {Compared to youths who believe that personal traits are malleable, those who believe that personal traits are fixed experience more academic and self-regulatory distress. Recently, studies have begun to explore relations between beliefs about the malleability of personal traits, or implicit theories, and youth mental health problems. We synthesized this emerging body of research in youths (ages 4–19) across 45 effect sizes from 17 research reports. Studies were included if they assessed youth mental health and implicit theories and did not manipulate implicit theory or affective/behavioral states prior to measuring these variables. Our random-effects meta-analysis using clustered data analysis techniques (i.e., effect sizes nested within samples) revealed that youths holding entity theories—the belief that personal traits are fixed—showed more pronounced mental health problems. This association between entity theories and mental health problems was evident across methodological factors and problem types (internalizing versus externalizing; psychopathology versus general distress). Limitations include the small number of eligible studies, insufficient data to test further demographic moderators, and few longitudinal studies on this topic. Overall, findings support the value of parsing the implicit theory–mental health link in youths. Implicit theories may prove to be promising targets for treatment and prevention of youth mental health problems.},

Earlier approaches have been primarily concerned with the spatial coherence of the {BOLD} response in local neighborhoods. In addition to a smoothness constraint, we propose to incorporate prior knowledge of brain activation patterns learned from training samples. This spatially informed prior can significantly enhance the estimation process by inducing sensitivity to task related regions of the brain. As {fMRI} data exhibits intersubject variability in functional anatomy, we design the prior using Independent Component Analysis ({ICA}). Due to the non-Gaussian assumption, {ICA} does not regress to the mean activation pattern and thus avoids suppressing intersubject differences. Results from a real {fMRI} experiment indicate that our approach provides statistically significant improvement in estimating activation compared to the standard general linear model ({GLM}) based methods.},

In this study, we investigated the development of social influence on risk perception from late childhood through adulthood. Five hundred and sixty-three participants rated the riskiness of everyday situations and were then informed about the ratings of a social-influence group (teenagers or adults) before rating each situation again. All age groups showed a significant social-influence effect, changing their risk ratings in the direction of the provided ratings; this social-influence effect decreased with age. Most age groups adjusted their ratings more to conform to the ratings of the adult social-influence group than to the ratings of the teenager social-influence group. Only young adolescents were more strongly influenced by the teenager social-influence group than they were by the adult social-influence group, which suggests that to early adolescents, the opinions of other teenagers about risk matter more than the opinions of adults.},

However, their results did not apply to the more typical case of partial mediation. We extend their previous work by showing that substantial bias can also occur with partial mediation. In particular, cross-sectional analyses can imply the existence of a substantial indirect effect even when the true longitudinal indirect effect is zero. Thus, a variable that is found to be a strong mediator in a cross-sectional analysis may not be a mediator at all in a longitudinal analysis. In addition, we show that very different combinations of longitudinal parameter values can lead to essentially identical cross-sectional correlations, raising serious questions about the interpretability of cross-sectional mediation data. More generally, researchers are encouraged to consider a wide variety of possible mediation models beyond simple cross-sectional models, including but not restricted to autoregressive models of change.},

In both studies, participants were told either that the target female would choose her date (intersexual) or that male suitors would nominate one another (intrasexual). Under the intersexual selection condition, men demonstrated increased creativity levels and decreased aggression levels, whereas the opposite pattern was observed under the intrasexual selection condition.

Response magnitude correlated with the “intention to trust” on the next play of the game, and the peak of these “intention to trust” responses shifted its time of occurrence by 14 seconds as player reputations developed. This temporal transfer resembles a similar shift of reward prediction errors common to reinforcement learning models, but in the context of a social exchange.

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) has illuminated the development of human brain function. Some of this work in typically-developing youth has ostensibly captured neural underpinnings of adolescent behavior which is characterized by risk-seeking propensity, according to psychometric questionnaires and a wealth of anecdote. Notably, cross-sectional comparisons have revealed age-dependent differences between adolescents and other age groups in regional brain responsiveness to prospective or experienced rewards (usually greater in adolescents) or penalties (usually diminished in adolescents). These differences have been interpreted as reflecting an imbalance between motivational drive and behavioral control mechanisms, especially in mid-adolescence, thus promoting greater risk-taking. While intriguing, we caution here that researchers should be more circumspect in attributing clinically significant adolescent risky behavior to age-group differences in task-elicited {fMRI} responses from neurotypical subjects. This is because actual mortality and morbidity from behavioral causes (e.g. substance abuse, violence) by mid-adolescence is heavily concentrated in individuals who are not neurotypical, who rather have shown a lifelong history of behavioral disinhibition that frequently meets criteria for a disruptive behavior disorder, such as conduct disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. These young people are at extreme risk of poor psychosocial outcomes, and should be a focus of future neurodevelopmental research.},

We describe rodent studies, neuroimaging, and large-scale behavioural studies in humans that have yielded data that are consistent with heightened neuroplasticity in adolescence. Critically however, concrete evidence for sensitive periods in adolescence is mostly lacking. To provide conclusive evidence, experimental studies are needed that directly manipulate environmental input and compare effects in child, adolescent, and adult groups.},

We recruited 55 individuals afflicted with borderline personality disorder ({BPD}) to play a multiround economic exchange game with healthy partners. Behaviorally, individuals with {BPD} showed a profound incapacity to maintain cooperation, and were impaired in their ability to repair broken cooperation on the basis of a quantitative measure of coaxing. Neurally, activity in the anterior insula, a region known to respond to norm violations across affective, interoceptive, economic, and social dimensions, strongly differentiated healthy participants from individuals with {BPD}. Healthy subjects showed a strong linear relation between anterior insula response and both magnitude of monetary offer received from their partner (input) and the amount of money repaid to their partner (output). In stark contrast, activity in the anterior insula of {BPD} participants was related only to the magnitude of repayment sent back to their partner (output), not to the magnitude of offers received (input). These neural and behavioral data suggest that norms used in perception of social gestures are pathologically perturbed or missing altogether among individuals with {BPD}.

	abstract = {Social acceptance is of key importance for healthy functioning. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to examine age-related changes in the neural correlates of social acceptance and rejection processing. Participants from four age groups participated in the study: pre-pubertal children (8–10 years), early adolescents (12–14 years), older adolescents (16–17 years) and young adults (19–25 years). During the experiment, participants were presented with unfamiliar faces of peers and were asked to predict whether they expected to be liked or disliked by the other person, followed by feedback indicating acceptance or rejection. Results showed that activation in the ventral {mPFC} and striatum to social feedback was context-dependent; there was increased activation when participants had positive expectations about social evaluation, and increased activation following social acceptance feedback. Age-related comparisons revealed a linear increase in activity with age in these brain regions for positive expectations of social evaluation. Similarly, a linear increase with age was found for activation in the striatum, ventral {mPFC}, {OFC}, and lateral {PFC} for rejection feedback. No age-related differences in neural activation were shown for social acceptance feedback. Together, these results provide important insights in the developmental trajectories of brain regions implicated in social and affective behavior.},

Recent studies have demonstrated the recruitment of regions like the ventral tegmental area, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the ventral striatum to self-specific stimuli—regions typically associated with reward-related processing. This raises the question of whether there is a relationship between self and reward and, if so, how these different fields can be linked. Three relationship models that aim to explore the relationship between self and reward are discussed here: integration, segregation, and parallel processing. Their pros and cons are reviewed in light of the most recent findings. The conclusion is that both the fields of self and reward may benefit from increased interaction. This interaction may help to fill in some of the missing pieces regarding reward-related processing, as well as illuminate how brain function can bring forward the philosophical concept and psychological reality of self.},

	abstract = {Amazon Mechanical Turk ({AMT}) is an online crowdsourcing service where anonymous online workers complete web-based tasks for small sums of money. The service has attracted attention from experimental psychologists interested in gathering human subject data more efficiently. However, relative to traditional laboratory studies, many aspects of the testing environment are not under the experimenter's control. In this paper, we attempt to empirically evaluate the fidelity of the {AMT} system for use in cognitive behavioral experiments. These types of experiment differ from simple surveys in that they require multiple trials, sustained attention from participants, comprehension of complex instructions, and millisecond accuracy for response recording and stimulus presentation. We replicate a diverse body of tasks from experimental psychology including the Stroop, Switching, Flanker, Simon, Posner Cuing, attentional blink, subliminal priming, and category learning tasks using participants recruited using {AMT}. While most of replications were qualitatively successful and validated the approach of collecting data anonymously online using a web-browser, others revealed disparity between laboratory results and online results. A number of important lessons were encountered in the process of conducting these replications that should be of value to other researchers.},

	abstract = {The concept of mirroring has become rather ubiquitous. One of the most fundamental empirical and theoretical debates within research on mirroring concerns the role of mental representations: while some models argue that higher-order representational mechanisms underpin most cases of mirroring, other models argue that they only moderate a primarily non-representational process. As such, even though research on mirroring—along with its neural substrates, including the putative mirror neuron system—has grown tremendously, so too has confusion about what it actually means to “mirror”. Using recent research on spontaneous imitation, we argue that flexible mirroring effects can be fully embodied and dynamic—even in the absence of higher-order mental representations. We propose that mirroring can simply reflect an adaptive integration and utilization of cues obtained from the brain, body, and environment, which is especially evident within the social context. Such a view offers reconciliation among both representational and non-representational frameworks in cognitive neuroscience, which will facilitate revised interpretations of modern (and seemingly divergent) findings on when and how these embodied mirroring responses are employed.},

Yet, the precise means through which individuals compete for social standing remains unclear. In 2 studies, we investigated the impact of 2 fundamental strategies—Dominance (the use of force and intimidation to induce fear) and Prestige (the sharing of expertise or know-how to gain respect)—on the attainment of social rank, which we conceptualized as the acquisition of (a) perceived influence over others (Study 1), (b) actual influence over others' behaviors (Study 1), and (c) others' visual attention (Study 2). Study 1 examined the process of hierarchy formation among a group of previously unacquainted individuals, who provided round-robin judgments of each other after completing a group task. Results indicated that the adoption of either a Dominance or Prestige strategy promoted perceptions of greater influence, by both group members and outside observers, and higher levels of actual influence, based on a behavioral measure. These effects were not driven by popularity; in fact, those who adopted a Prestige strategy were viewed as likable, whereas those who adopted a Dominance strategy were not well liked. In Study 2, participants viewed brief video clips of group interactions from Study 1 while their gaze was monitored with an eye tracker. Dominant and Prestigious targets each received greater visual attention than targets low on either dimension. Together, these findings demonstrate that Dominance and Prestige are distinct yet viable strategies for ascending the social hierarchy, consistent with evolutionary theory.},

This volume is a good beginning for those who wish to gain that understanding.” —Chance “Meta-analysis, as the statistical analysis of a large collection of results from individual studies is called, has now achieved a status of respectability in medicine. This respectability, when combined with the slight hint of mystique that sometimes surrounds meta-analysis, ensures that results of studies that use it are treated with the respect they deserve....The Handbook of Research Synthesis is one of the most important publications in this subject both as a definitive reference book and a practical manual.”—British Medical Journal The Handbook of Research Synthesis is the definitive reference and how-to manual for behavioral and medical scientists applying the craft of research synthesis. It draws upon twenty years of ground-breaking advances that have transformed the practice of synthesizing research literature from an art into a scientific process in its own right. Editors Harris Cooper and Larry V. Hedges have brought together leading authorities to guide the reader through every stage of the research synthesis process—problem formulation, literature search and evaluation, statistical integration, and report preparation. The Handbook of Research Synthesis incorporates in a single volume state-of-the-art techniques from all quantitative synthesis traditions, including Bayesian inference and the meta-analytic approaches. Distilling a vast technical literature and many informal sources, the Handbook provides a portfolio of the most effective solutions to problems of quantitative data integration. The Handbook of Research Synthesis also provides a rich treatment of the non-statistical aspects of research synthesis. Topics include searching the literature, managing reference databases and registries, and developing coding schemes. Those engaged in research synthesis will also find useful advice on how tables, graphs, and narration can be deployed to provide the most meaningful communication of the results of research synthesis. The Handbook of Research Synthesis is an illuminating compilation of practical instruction, theory, and problem solving. It provides an accumulation of knowledge about the craft of reviewing a scientific literature that can be found in no other single source. The Handbook offers the reader thorough instruction in the skills necessary to conduct powerful research syntheses meeting the highest standards of objectivity, systematicity, and rigor demanded of scientific enquiry. This definitive work will represent the state of the art in research synthesis for years to come.},

Although behavioral science recognizes that people can skillfully pursue goals without consciously attending to their behavior once these goals are set, conscious will is considered to be the starting point of goal pursuit. Indeed, when we decide to work hard on a task, it feels as if that conscious decision is the first and foremost cause of our behavior. That is, we are likely to say, if asked, that the decision to act produced the actions themselves. Recent discoveries, however, challenge this causal status of conscious will. They demonstrate that under some conditions, actions are initiated even though we are unconscious of the goals to be attained or their motivating effect on our behavior.

In particular, we show how activity in the cerebral cortex can make predictions about future receipt of reward and how fluctuations in the activity levels of neurons in diffuse dopamine systems above and below baseline levels would represent errors in these predictions that are delivered to cortical and subcortical targets. We present a model for how such errors could be constructed in a real brain that is consistent with physiological results for a subset of dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area and surrounding dopaminergic neurons. The theory also makes testable predictions about human choice behavior on a simple decision-making task. Furthermore, we show that, through a simple influence on synaptic plasticity, fluctuations in dopamine release can act to change the predictions in an appropriate manner.},

This article presents the Rescorla-Wagner model's basic assumptions, reviews some of the model's predictive successes and failures, relates the failures to the model's assumptions, and discusses the model's heuristic value. It is concluded that the model has had a positive influence on the study of simple associative learning by stimulating research and contributing to new model development.

This model retains the virtues of its predecessor and, in addition, accurately simulates many conditioning phenomena that are not encompassed by the original Rescorla–Wagner model: (a) the acquisition function is –S-shaped, and abrupt shifts in responsiveness occur during acquisition and extinction; (b) reacquisition is characteristically more rapid than the initial acquisition; (c) the behavioral effect of a set of conditioning operations is not necessarily independent of the S's prior conditioning history. In addition, the new model seems to cope more efficiently with latent inhibition and with the ineffectiveness of nonreinforcing a conditioned inhibitor. (61 ref)},

	abstract = {Accurately making a decision in the face of incongruent options increases the efficiency of making similar congruency decisions in the future. Contextual factors like reward can modulate this adaptive process, suggesting that networks associated with monitoring previous success and failure outcomes might contribute to this form of behavioral updating. To evaluate this possibility, a group of healthy adults (n = 30) were tested with functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) while they performed a color-word Stroop task. In a conflict-related region of the medial orbitofrontal cortex ({mOFC}), stronger {BOLD} responses predicted faster response times ({RTs}) on the next trial. More importantly, the degree of behavioral adaptation of {RTs} was correlated with the magnitude of {mOFC}-{RT} associations on the previous trial, but only after accounting for network-level interactions with prefrontal and striatal regions. This suggests that congruency sequencing effects may rely on interactions between distributed corticostriatal circuits. This possibility was evaluated by measuring the convergence of white matter projections from frontal areas into the striatum with diffusion-weighted imaging. In these pathways, greater convergence of corticostriatal projections correlated with stronger functional {mOFC}-{RT} associations that, in turn, provided an indirect pathway linking anatomical structure to behavior. Thus distributed corticostriatal processing may mediate the orbitofrontal cortex's influence on behavioral updating, even in the absence of explicit rewards.},

We have previously shown that performance in this task relies on sensitivity to accumulating negative outcomes in ventromedial {PFC} and dorsolateral {PFC}. Here, we further formalize outcome evaluation (as driven by prediction errors [{PE}], using a reinforcement learning model) and examine its development. Task performance improved significantly during adolescence, stabilizing in adulthood. Performance relied on greater impact of negative compared with positive {PEs}, the relative impact of which matured from adolescence into adulthood. Adolescents also showed increased exploratory behavior, expressed as a propensity to shift responding between options independently of outcome quality, whereas adults showed no systematic shifting patterns. The correlation between {PE} representation and improved performance strengthened with age for activation in ventral and dorsal {PFC}, ventral striatum, and temporal and parietal cortices. There was a medial-lateral distinction in the prefrontal substrates of effective {PE} utilization between adults and adolescents: Increased utilization of negative {PEs}, a hallmark of successful performance in the task, was associated with increased activation in ventromedial {PFC} in adults, but decreased activation in ventrolateral {PFC} and striatum in adolescents. These results suggest that adults and adolescents engage qualitatively distinct neural and psychological processes during decision-making, the development of which is not exclusively dependent on reward-processing maturation.},

	abstract = {When a stimulus is associated with a reward, it becomes prioritized, and the allocation of attention to that stimulus increases. For low-level features, such as color, this reward-based allocation of attention can manifest early in time and as a faster and stronger shift of attention to targets with that color, as reflected by the N2pc (a parieto-occipital electrophysiological component peaking at ∼250 msec). It is unknown, however, if reward associations can similarly modulate attentional shifts to complex objects or object categories, or if reward-related modulation of attentional allocation to such stimuli would occur later in time or through a different mechanism. Here, we used magnetoencephalographic recordings in 24 participants to investigate how object categories with a reward association would modulate the shift of attention. On each trial, two colored squares were presented, one in a target color and the other in a distractor color, each with an embedded object. Participants searched for the target-colored square and performed a corner discrimination task. The embedded objects were from either a rewarded or non-rewarded category, and if a rewarded-category object were present within the target-colored square, participants could earn extra money for correct performance. We observed that when the target color contained an object from a rewarded versus a non-rewarded category, the neural shift of attention to the target was faster and of greater magnitude, although the rewarded objects were not relevant for correct task performance. These results suggest that reward associations of complex objects can rapidly modulate attentional allocation to a target.},

However, we propose that sociometric status—the respect and admiration one has in face-to-face groups (e.g., among friends or coworkers)—has a stronger effect on {SWB} than does socioeconomic status. Using correlational, experimental, and longitudinal methodologies, four studies found consistent evidence for a local-ladder effect: Sociometric status significantly predicted satisfaction with life and the experience of positive and negative emotions. Longitudinally, as sociometric status rose or fell, {SWB} rose or fell accordingly. Furthermore, these effects were driven by feelings of power and social acceptance. Overall, individuals’ sociometric status matters more to their {SWB} than does their socioeconomic status.},

Adolescent participants took part in an interaction in which they teased an opposite-gender friend (Study 1) or an experiment in which taunting or cheering expectations were manipulated (Study 2). Consistent with the hypothesis, high-status boys and girls engaged in teasing behaviors consistent with their gender roles, relative to their low status counterparts (Study 1).

	abstract = {This dissertation evaluates, refines, and extends to a new paradigm, a set of stochastic models that describe the cognitive processes of individuals while they complete multiple trials of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task ({BART}; Lejuez et al., 2002). Wallsten, Pleskac, and Lejuez (2004) designed the models using prospect theory and a Bayesian learning process to better understand why the {BART} correlates so well with self-reported risky behaviors. The models differed in terms of the individuals' beliefs of the task's probabilistic structure and when option evaluations occur. The models revealed that although respondents use a Bayesian learning process to understand the task, they misunderstand the {BART}'s stochastic process as stationary. Results also indicated that individuals' attitudes toward outcomes are, in part, a source of the {BART}'s success. From these conclusions a new task was developed that allows manipulations of both the actual stochastic structure and the individuals' level of knowledge regarding the structure. Participants (N = 71) completed four different conditions of the task. Fitting the various cognitive models to each individual's data revealed that only a subset of the models correctly distinguished between the stochastic processes underlying the different conditions. Incorporating prospect theory's weighting function and a trial-dependent bias component into the models accounted for performance differences between conditions. Of the assorted model parameters, only prospect theory's value function correlated with external self-reported risky drug use. The results also showed that the learning component of the original {BART} may cloud its association to risky behaviors. Implications in terms of gambling tasks and the cognitive models will be discussed.},

	abstract = {A sequential risk-taking paradigm used to identify real-world risk takers invokes both learning and decision processes. This article expands the paradigm to a larger class of tasks with different stochastic environments and different learning requirements. Generalizing a Bayesian sequential risk-taking model to the larger set of tasks clarifies the roles of learning and decision making during sequential risky choice. Results show that respondents adapt their learning processes and associated mental representations of the task to the stochastic environment. Furthermore, their Bayesian learning processes are shown to interfere with the paradigm's identification of risky drug use, whereas the decision-making process facilitates its diagnosticity. Theoretical implications of the results in terms of both understanding risk-taking behavior and improving risk-taking assessment methods are discussed.},

The name of the philosopher Charles Peirce was misspelled throughout as Charles Pierce.] The 3 most often-used performance measures in the cognitive and decision sciences are choice, response or decision time, and confidence. We develop a random walk/diffusion theory—2-stage dynamic signal detection (2DSD) theory—that accounts for all 3 measures using a common underlying process. The model uses a drift diffusion process to account for choice and decision time. To estimate confidence, we assume that evidence continues to accumulate after the choice. Judges then interrupt the process to categorize the accumulated evidence into a confidence rating. The model explains all known interrelationships between the 3 indices of performance. Furthermore, the model also accounts for the distributions of each variable in both a perceptual and general knowledge task. The dynamic nature of the model also reveals the moderating effects of time pressure on the accuracy of choice and confidence. Finally, the model specifies the optimal solution for giving the fastest choice and confidence rating for a given level of choice and confidence accuracy. Judges are found to act in a manner consistent with the optimal solution when making confidence judgments.},

First, alpha always has a value, which cannot be equal to the test score’s reliability given the interitem covariance matrix and the usual assumptions about measurement error. Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test’s internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals’ test performance. The paper ends with a list of conclusions about the usefulness of alpha.},

Here, we assessed the influence of sensitivity to negative feedback (e.g., loss) and learning on age-related changes in risky decision making, both of which show unique developmental trajectories. In the present study, we examined risky decision making in 216 individuals, ranging in age from 3–26 years, using the balloon emotional learning task ({BELT}), a computerized task in which participants pump up a series of virtual balloons to earn points, but risk balloon explosion on each trial, which results in no points. It is important to note that there were 3 balloon conditions, signified by different balloon colors, ranging from quick- to slow-to-explode, and participants could learn the color–condition pairings through task experience. Overall, we found age-related increases in pumps made and points earned. However, in the quick-to-explode condition, there was a nonlinear adolescent peak for points earned. Follow-up analyses indicated that this adolescent phenotype occurred at the developmental intersection of linear age-related increases in learning and decreases in sensitivity to negative feedback. Adolescence was marked by intermediate values on both these processes. These findings show that a combination of linearly changing processes can result in nonlinear changes in risky decision making, the adolescent-specific nature of which is associated with developmental improvements in learning and reduced sensitivity to negative feedback.},

In fact, the best demographic, crime, and health statistics show that adolescents do not take excessive risks compared to adults, adolescent risks are associated much more significantly with conditions of poverty and corresponding adult behaviors than with uniquely adolescent factors, and middle-aged adults exposed to the same high poverty levels as American youth display similar or higher levels of crime, violent death, firearms mortality, traffic fatalities, and other behaviors conventionally associates with adolescents. “Teenage brain” theories and the views of youth and policies they entail require much more rigorous scrutiny than they have received to date.},

Taking population-level data about teenagers’ involvement in drinking, smoking, dangerous driving and unprotected sex as indicative, a consensus has developed about the association between risk-taking and the temporal misalignment in the development of reward-seeking and executive regions of the brain.

There are epistemological difficulties in this theory. Risk, the brain, and adolescence are different kinds of objects, and bringing them into the same frame for analysis is not unproblematic. In particular, risk is inextricably contextual and value-driven. The assessment of adolescent behaviour and decision-making as ‘sub-optimal’, and the implication that the developmental schedule of the teenage brain is dysfunctional, is also reassessed in terms of evolutionary development of the individual, the family and the human community. The paper proposes a view of adolescent development as adaptive, and a focus on young people’s capacities in the profile of the needs of the community as a whole.},

The model holds that people's implicit theories about human attributes structure the way they understand and react to human actions and outcomes. We review research showing that when people believe that attributes (such as intelligence or moral character) are fixed, trait-like entities (an entity theory), they tend to understand outcomes and actions in terms of these fixed traits ("I failed the test because I am dumb" or "He stole the bread because he is dishonest"). In contrast, when people believe that attributes are more dynamic, malleable, and developable (an incremental theory), they tend to focus less on broad traits and, instead, tend to understand outcomes and actions in terms of more specific behavioral or psychological mediators ("I failed the test because of my effort or strategy" or "He stole the bread because he was desperate"). The two frameworks also appear to foster different reactions: helpless versus mastery-oriented responses to personal setbacks and an emphasis on retribution versus education or rehabilitation for transgressions. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for personality, motivation, and social perception.},

In this work we derive a necessary condition for the lasso variable selection to be consistent. Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the lasso is inconsistent for variable selection. We then propose a new version of the lasso, called the adaptive lasso, where adaptive weights are used for penalizing different coefficients in the ℓ1 penalty. We show that the adaptive lasso enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as if the true underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm for solving the lasso. We also discuss the extension of the adaptive lasso in generalized linear models and show that the oracle properties still hold under mild regularity conditions. As a byproduct of our theory, the nonnegative garotte is shown to be consistent for variable selection.},

We argue in response that the critical evidence is not these effects of situations observed in social psychological experiments, but evidence of stable individual differences obtained from correlations of individual’s behaviors across multiple contexts. The totality of the empirical evidence is shown to support this claim: broad traits are real, prominent, and consequential, and these traits, conceptualized as density distributions of personality states, exhibit remarkable consistency. In short, the evidence in favor of individual differences is empirically solid, and the study of ethics focused on virtue is not threatened by psychological research.},

A popular notion emerging from this work states that a relative immaturity in frontal cortical neural systems could explain adolescents' high rates of risk-taking, substance use and other dangerous behaviours. However, developmental neuroimaging studies do not support a simple model of frontal cortical immaturity. Rather, growing evidence points to the importance of changes in social and affective processing, which begin around the onset of puberty, as crucial to understanding these adolescent vulnerabilities. These changes in social–affective processing also may confer some adaptive advantages, such as greater flexibility in adjusting one's intrinsic motivations and goal priorities amidst changing social contexts in adolescence.},

However, activation in the temporal-parietal-junction ({rTPJ}), bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) was modulated by individual differences in {SVO}. In addition, these regions were differentially sensitive to manipulations of risk for the trustor when reciprocating. In contrast, the {ACC} and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were sensitive to the benefit for the trustee when reciprocating. Together, the results of this study provide more insight in how several brain regions work together when individuals reciprocate trust, by showing how these regions are differentially sensitive to reciprocity motives and perspective-taking.},

Existing theories have debated the origins and nature of this relationship, offering both structural/fixed and environmental/dynamic explanations. We tested the novel and straightforward dynamic hypothesis that part of the reason trait extraversion predicts trait positive affect is through an increased propensity to enact extraverted states, which in turn leads to experiencing more positive affect states. We report 5 experience sampling studies (and a meta-analysis of primary studies) conducted in natural environments and laboratory settings in which undergraduate participants (N = 241) provided ratings of trait extraversion, trait positive affect, extraversion states, and positive affect states. Results of primary studies and the meta-analysis showed that relationships between trait extraversion and trait positive affect were partially mediated by aggregated extraversion states and aggregated positive affect states. The results supported our dynamic hypothesis and suggested that dynamic explanations of the relationship between trait extraversion and trait positive affect are compatible with structural explanations. An important implication of these findings is that individuals might be able to increase their happiness by self-regulating their extraverted states.},

By using a model in which personality states serve as an outcome of specific, momentary goal pursuit, we were able to identify the function of extraversion states in everyday behavior. Using experience-sampling methodology, we asked participants to describe their state extraversion, goal pursuit, and state affect over 10 days. Results show that 18 selected goals predicted 74\% of the variance in state extraversion; both within-person and between-person fluctuations in state extraversion were strongly associated with changes in momentary goal pursuit. We extended findings relating state extraversion and state positive affect, showing that the relationship between goals and positive affect was partially mediated by state extraversion.},

First, the descriptive side of traits can be conceptualized as density distributions of states. Second, it is important to provide an explanatory account of the Big 5 traits. Third, adding an explanatory account to the Big 5 creates two parts to traits, an explanatory part and a descriptive part, and these two parts can be recognized as separate entities that are joined into whole traits. Fourth, Whole Trait Theory proposes that the explanatory side of traits consists of social-cognitive mechanisms. Fifth, social-cognitive mechanisms that produce Big-5 states should be identified.},

To fill the need for reliable and theoretically grounded measurement of the full range of moral concerns, we developed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire on the basis of a theoretical model of 5 universally available (but variably developed) sets of moral intuitions: Harm/Care, Fairness/Reciprocity, Ingroup/Loyalty, Authority/Respect, and Purity/Sanctity. We present evidence for the internal and external validity of the scale and the model, and in doing so we present new findings about morality: (a) Comparative model fitting of confirmatory factor analyses provides empirical justification for a 5-factor structure of moral concerns; (b) convergent/discriminant validity evidence suggests that moral concerns predict personality features and social group attitudes not previously considered morally relevant; and (c) we establish pragmatic validity of the measure in providing new knowledge and research opportunities concerning demographic and cultural differences in moral intuitions. These analyses provide evidence for the usefulness of Moral Foundations Theory in simultaneously increasing the scope and sharpening the resolution of psychological views of morality.},

On this definition of morality, conservative opposition to social justice programs appears to be immoral, and has been explained as a product of various non-moral processes such as system justification or social dominance orientation. In this article we argue that, from an anthropological perspective, the moral domain is usually much broader, encompassing many more aspects of social life and valuing institutions as much or more than individuals. We present theoretical and empirical reasons for believing that there are five psychological systems that provide the foundations for the world’s many moralities. The five foundations are psychological preparations for detecting and reacting emotionally to issues related to harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Political liberals have moral intuitions primarily based upon the first two foundations, and therefore misunderstand the moral motivations of political conservatives, who generally rely upon all five foundations.},

Using a large longitudinal sample of German males, we examined whether personality traits played a role during this period. Results indicated that personality traits prospectively predicted the decision to enter the military. People lower in agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness to experience during high school were more likely to enter the military after graduation. In addition, military training was associated with changes in personality. Compared with a control group, military recruits had lower levels of agreeableness after training. These levels persisted 5 years after training, even after participants entered college or the labor market. This study is one of the first to identify life experiences associated with changes in personality traits. Moreover, our results suggest that military experiences may have a long-lasting influence on individual-level characteristics.},

	abstract = {Mediation analysis uses measures of hypothesized mediating variables to test theory for how a treatment achieves effects on outcomes and to improve subsequent treatments by identifying the most efficient treatment components. Most current mediation analysis methods rely on untested distributional and functional form assumptions for valid conclusions, especially regarding the relation between the mediator and outcome variables. Propensity score methods offer an alternative whereby the propensity score is used to compare individuals in the treatment and control groups who would have had the same value of the mediator had they been assigned to the same treatment condition. This article describes the use of propensity score weighting for mediation with a focus on explicating the underlying assumptions. Propensity scores have the potential to offer an alternative estimation procedure for mediation analysis with alternative assumptions from those of standard mediation analysis. The methods are illustrated investigating the mediational effects of an intervention to improve sense of mastery to reduce depression using data from the Job Search Intervention Study ({JOBS} {II}). We find significant treatment effects for those individuals who would have improved sense of mastery when in the treatment condition but no effects for those who would not have improved sense of mastery under treatment.},

In this rejoinder, we primarily focus on these commentaries by (i) clarifying the main differences between the latent versus the network view on traits; (ii) discussing some of the arguments in favour of the latent trait views that were put forward by these commentators; and by (iii) comparing the capacity of both views to explain thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Some commentators were by and large positive about the network perspective, and we discuss their excellent suggestions for defining components and linking these to genes and other biological mechanisms. We conclude that no doors should be closed in the study of personality and that, as such, alternative theories such as the network perspective should be welcomed, formalised and tested.

	abstract = {This paper generalizes Freeman's geodesic centrality measures for betweenness on undirected graphs to the more general directed case. Four steps are taken. The point centrality measure is first generalized for directed graphs. Second, a unique maximally centralized graph is defined for directed graphs, holding constant the numbers of points with reciprocatable (incoming and outgoing) versus only unreciprocatable (outgoing only or incoming only) arcs, and focusing the measure on the maximally central arrangement of arcs within these constraints. Alternatively, one may simply normalize on the number of arcs. This enables the third step of defining the relative betweenness centralities of a point, independent of the number of points. This normalization step for directed centrality measures removes Gould's objection that centrality measures for directed graphs are not interpretable because they lack a standard for maximality. The relative directed centrality converges with Freeman's betweenness measure in the case of undirected graphs with no isolates. The fourth step is to define the measures of this concept of graph centralization in terms of the dominance of the most central point.},

Three studies documented that state and trait disgust, but not other negative emotions, moralize the purity moral domain but not the moral domains of justice or harm/care. In Study 1, integral feelings of disgust, but not integral anger, predicted stronger moral condemnation of behaviors violating purity. In Study 2, experimentally induced disgust, compared with induced sadness, increased condemnation of behaviors violating purity and increased approval of behaviors upholding purity. In Study 3, trait disgust, but not trait anger or trait fear, predicted stronger condemnation of purity violations and greater approval of behaviors upholding purity. We found that, confirming the domain specificity of the disgust–purity association, disgust was unrelated to moral judgments about justice (Studies 1 and 2) or harm/care (Study 3). Finally, across studies, individuals of lower socioeconomic status ({SES}) were more likely than individuals of higher {SES} to moralize purity but not justice or harm/care.},

They discuss the ways that religion is intertwined with five moral foundations, in particular the group-focused “binding” foundations of Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, Purity/sanctity.

	abstract = {Genuine moral disagreement exists and is widespread. To understand such disagreement, we must examine the basic kinds of social relationships people construct across cultures and the distinct moral obligations and prohibitions these relationships entail. We extend relational models theory (Fiske, 1991) to identify 4 fundamental and distinct moral motives. Unity is the motive to care for and support the integrity of in-groups by avoiding or eliminating threats of contamination and providing aid and protection based on need or empathic compassion. Hierarchy is the motive to respect rank in social groups where superiors are entitled to deference and respect but must also lead, guide, direct, and protect subordinates. Equality is the motive for balanced, in-kind reciprocity, equal treatment, equal say, and equal opportunity. Proportionality is the motive for rewards and punishments to be proportionate to merit, benefits to be calibrated to contributions, and judgments to be based on a utilitarian calculus of costs and benefits. The 4 moral motives are universal, but cultures, ideologies, and individuals differ in where they activate these motives and how they implement them. Unlike existing theories (Haidt, 2007; Hauser, 2006; Turiel, 1983), relationship regulation theory predicts that any action, including violence, unequal treatment, and “impure” acts, may be perceived as morally correct depending on the moral motive employed and how the relevant social relationship is construed. This approach facilitates clearer understanding of moral perspectives we disagree with and provides a template for how to influence moral motives and practices in the world.},

	abstract = {Complex functional brain networks are large networks of brain regions and functional brain connections. Statistical characterizations of these networks aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state functional {MRI} datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.},

Statistical Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying signal in a set of data.  Top experts in this rapidly evolving field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation. They discuss the application of l1 penalties to generalized linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review numerical methods for optimization. They also present statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models, including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models, and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of theoretical results for the lasso.  In this age of big data, the number of features measured on a person or object can be large and might be larger than the number of observations. This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer scientists, and theorists will appreciate this thorough and up-to-date treatment of sparse statistical modeling.},

	abstract = {Factor analyses of 75 facet scales from 2 major Big Five inventories, in the Eugene-Springfield community sample (N=481), produced a 2-factor solution for the 15 facets in each domain. These findings indicate the existence of 2 distinct (but correlated) aspects within each of the Big Five, representing an intermediate level of personality structure between facets and domains. The authors characterized these factors in detail at the item level by correlating factor scores with the International Personality Item Pool (L. R. Goldberg, 1999). These correlations allowed the construction of a 100-item measure of the 10 factors (the Big Five Aspect Scales [{BFAS}]), which was validated in a 2nd sample (N=480). Finally, the authors examined the correlations of the 10 factors with scores derived from 10 genetic factors that a previous study identified underlying the shared variance among the Revised {NEO} Personality Inventory facets (K. L. Jang et al., 2002). The correspondence was strong enough to suggest that the 10 aspects of the Big Five may have distinct biological substrates.},

	abstract = {In one currently dominant view on personality, personality dimensions (e.g. extraversion) are causes of human behaviour, and personality inventory items (e.g. ‘I like to go to parties’ and ‘I like people’) are measurements of these dimensions. In this view, responses to extraversion items correlate because they measure the same latent dimension. In this paper, we challenge this way of thinking and offer an alternative perspective on personality as a system of connected affective, cognitive and behavioural components. We hypothesize that these components do not hang together because they measure the same underlying dimension; they do so because they depend on one another directly for causal, homeostatic or logical reasons (e.g. if one does not like people and it is harder to enjoy parties). From this ‘network perspective’, personality dimensions emerge out of the connectivity structure that exists between the various components of personality. After outlining the network theory, we illustrate how it applies to personality research in four domains: (i) the overall organization of personality components; (ii) the distinction between state and trait; (iii) the genetic architecture of personality; and (iv) the relation between personality and psychopathology.

Besides shedding much light on the philosophical notion of causality itself, this graphical framework now contains many powerful concepts of relevance to the controversies just mentioned. In this article, some of these concepts are applied to areas of personality research where questions of causation arise, including the analysis of observational data and the genetic sources of individual differences.

Questioning the notion of a common factor as an as-yet-unobserved common cause of a behaviour domain's exemplars, the authors propose using graphical representations to inspire hypotheses of more complex causal structures. I do not find the case for the de-emphasis of the common factor model to be compelling for those behaviour domains (cognitive abilities) with which I am most familiar. It behoves all personality psychologists, however, to question the foundations of their favoured tools. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Studies of brain development suggest that the increase in risk taking observed during adolescence may be due to insufficient prefrontal executive function compared to a more rapidly developing subcortical motivation system. We examined executive function as assessed by working memory ability in a community sample of youth (n = 387, ages 10 to 12 at baseline) in three annual assessments to determine its relation to two forms of impulsivity (sensation seeking and acting without thinking) and a wide range of risk and externalizing behavior. Using structural equation modeling, we tested a model in which differential activation of the dorsal and ventral striatum produces imbalance in the function of these brain regions. For youth high in sensation seeking, both regions were predicted to develop with age. However, for youth high in the tendency to act without thinking, the ventral striatum was expected to dominate. The model predicted that working memory ability would exhibit (1) early weakness in youth high in acting without thinking but (2) growing strength in those high in sensation seeking. In addition, it predicted that (3) acting without thinking would be more strongly related to risk and externalizing behavior than sensation seeking. Finally, it predicted that (4) controlling for acting without thinking, sensation seeking would predict later increases in risky and externalizing behavior. All four of these predictions were confirmed. The results indicate that the rise in sensation seeking that occurs during adolescence is not accompanied by a deficit in executive function and therefore requires different intervention strategies from those for youth whose impulsivity is characterized by early signs of acting without thinking.},

Although research on the ultimate consequences of personality differences in nonhuman animals has recently undergone a surge of interest, our understanding of whether and how personality influences reproductive decisions in humans has remained limited and informed primarily by modern societies with low mortality–fertility schedules. Taking an evolutionary approach, we use data from a contemporary polygynous high-fertility human population living in rural Senegal to investigate whether personality dimensions are associated with key life-history traits in humans, i.e., quantity and quality of offspring. We show that personality dimensions predict reproductive success differently in men and women in such societies and, in women, are associated with a trade-off between offspring quantity and quality. In women, neuroticism positively predicts the number of children, both between and within polygynous families. Furthermore, within the low social class, offspring quality (i.e., child nutritional status) decreases with a woman's neuroticism, indicating a reproductive trade-off between offspring quantity and quality. Consistent with this, maximal fitness is achieved by women at an intermediate neuroticism level. In men, extraversion was found to be a strong predictor of high social class and polygyny, with extraverted men producing more offspring than their introverted counterparts. These results have implications for the consideration of alternative adaptive hypotheses in the current debate on the maintenance of personality differences and the role of individual factors in fertility patterns in contemporary humans.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Human personality is described preferentially in terms of factors (dimensions) found using factor analysis. An alternative and highly related method is network analysis, which may have several advantages over factor analytic methods.

Aim
To directly compare the ability of network community detection ({NCD}) and principal component factor analysis ({PCA}) to examine modularity in multidimensional datasets such as the neuroticism-extraversion-openness personality inventory revised ({NEO}-{PI}-R).

Methods
434 healthy subjects were tested on the {NEO}-{PI}-R. {PCA} was performed to extract factor structures ({FS}) of the current dataset using both item scores and facet scores. Correlational network graphs were constructed from univariate correlation matrices of interactions between both items and facets. These networks were pruned in a link-by-link fashion while calculating the network community structure ({NCS}) of each resulting network using the Wakita Tsurumi clustering algorithm. {NCSs} were matched against {FS} and networks of best matches were kept for further analysis.

Results
At facet level, {NCS} showed a best match (96.2\%) with a ‘confirmatory’ 5-{FS}. At item level, {NCS} showed a best match (80\%) with the standard 5-{FS} and involved a total of 6 network clusters. Lesser matches were found with ‘confirmatory’ 5-{FS} and ‘exploratory’ 6-{FS} of the current dataset. Network analysis did not identify facets as a separate level of organization in between items and clusters. A small-world network structure was found in both item- and facet level networks.

Conclusion
We present the first optimized network graph of personality traits according to the {NEO}-{PI}-R: a ‘Personality Web’. Such a web may represent the possible routes that subjects can take during personality development. {NCD} outperforms {PCA} by producing plausible modularity at item level in non-standard datasets, and can identify the key roles of individual items and clusters in the network.},

	abstract = {We consider Bayesian model selection in generalized linear models that are high-dimensional, with the number of covariates p being large relative to the sample size n, but sparse in that the number of active covariates is small compared to p. Treating the covariates as random and adopting an asymptotic scenario in which p increases with n, we show that Bayesian model selection using certain priors on the set of models is asymptotically equivalent to selecting a model using an extended Bayesian information criterion. Moreover, we prove that the smallest true model is selected by either of these methods with probability tending to one. Having addressed random covariates, we are also able to give a consistency result for pseudo-likelihood approaches to high-dimensional sparse graphical modeling. Experiments on real data demonstrate good performance of the extended Bayesian information criterion for regression and for graphical models.},

In support of a goal-congruence mechanism, Study 1 showed that communal goals, rather than perceived similarity, mediated the effects, and Studies 2-4 demonstrated that agreeable perceivers were particularly sensitive to communal (vs. agentic) violations. A longitudinal study of real-life impressions supported the laboratory evidence that agreeable people are highly sensitive to both the prosocial and antisocial behavior of others (Study 4).

This paper explores the relations between the Five Factor Model ({FFM}) of personality and a variety of risky sexual behaviors using a community sample of 481 individuals who are part of an ongoing longitudinal study. More specifically, we examined the relations between the five major personality domains, as well as the 30 specific facets, and six risky sexual behaviors including number of partners, the use of drugs or alcohol before or during sex, number of sexual acts without using a condom, giving birth at an early age, sex outside one's primary relationship, and early sexual initiation. The results suggest that personality can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of several risky sexual behaviors. In particular, the domains of low Agreeableness, low Openness to Experience, and high Extraversion were significantly related to multiple high risk sexual behaviors. In addition, several specific personality traits made significant contributions (e.g., high gregariousness, high excitement seeking, low openness to fantasy, low trust, and low straightforwardness).},

These participants’ interpersonal styles were also assessed using the primary dimensions of the {IPC}: dominance and warmth. As predicted, a positive linear relation was found, for men and women, between interpersonal dominance and the number of partners a person had for each type of sexual activity. Additionally, for both men and women, a curvilinear relation was found between interpersonal warmth and the number of partners a person had for each type of sexual activity. Specifically, participants who were either extremely warm or extremely cold tended to have more sexual partners than individuals who were moderately warm. These findings extend past research linking the Five Factor Model traits of extraversion and agreeableness to sexual promiscuity and also help illustrate the dual interpersonal meaning of sexual experience.},

Recent advances in personality research that have delineated multiple, separate dispositions to engage in risky behaviors may help to clarify the personality contribution to risk for this problem. Design  The authors compared the prospective roles of sensation seeking, lack of planning, lack of perseverance, negative urgency and positive urgency (dispositions to engage in rash action when in an unusually negative or positive mood, respectively) in predicting increases in drinking frequency, drinking quantity and negative outcomes from consumption across the first year of college. Setting  University of Kentucky campus. Participants  A total of 418 first-year {US} college students enrolled in an Introduction to Psychology course during the first assessment; 293 participants completed both phases of the study. Measurements  Participants completed self-report measures of personality and drinking behavior twice during the first year of college [the {UPPS}-R Impulsive Behavior Scale, positive urgency measure ({PUM}) and Drinking Styles Questionnaire ({DSQ})]. Findings  Whereas sensation seeking related to increases in the frequency with which college students drank alcohol, positive urgency predicted increases in (i) the quantity of alcohol students consumed at any given drinking episode and (ii) negative outcomes experienced from drinking. Conclusions  It appears that although sensation seeking is a risk factor for participation in drinking behaviors, risk for increased quantity of consumption and its negative outcomes may be more a function of dyscontrol stemming from high positive mood for college students.},

The primary cause of this increase in morbidity and mortality is heightened risky behavior including drinking, driving, drug-taking, smoking, and unprotected sex. Why is it that some adolescents take big risks, while others do not? One potential source of individual differences in risk-taking behavior may lie in individual differences in executive function including judgment, impulse control, self-monitoring, and planning. Researchers have hypothesized that limited brain system integration and efficiency, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and related structures, may be involved in the range and degree of risky behavior commonly exhibited by teens. In the present study, we examined the relation between risky behavior, personality factors, and performance on neuropsychological tests of executive function. The community sample of 136 adolescents aged 13- to 17-years-old and 57 emerging adults aged 18- to 22-years-old exhibited marked individual differences in risk-taking behavior; participants' scores on a alcohol, smoking, drugs, sex, driving, and antisocial behavior questionnaire ranged from 0 to near the maximum value possible. We found that risky personality and performance on the neuropsychological tests were both significant predictors of real-world risk-taking. These data have important implications for current public policies involving adolescents and emerging adults.},

In three studies, the authors showed that negative urgency concurrently predicted alcohol dependence symptoms in disordered women, drinking problems and smoker status in preadolescents, and aggression, risky sex, illegal drug use, drinking problems, and conduct disordered behavior in college students. High Neuroticism traits predicted internalizing dysfunction but predicted none of these externalizing criteria beyond negative urgency.

Emotionality was associated with less risk-taking in both domains. In contrast, low Conscientiousness was only associated with greater risk-taking to achieve gains.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the links between adolescent risk-taking and personality in a comprehensive manner, as opposed to focusing on any one particular risk or personality factor as has occurred in much previous research. We conceptualized risk-taking broadly through use of the Adolescent Risk Questionnaire ({ARQ}) which yields information relating to risk judgements and behaviours in four areas (i.e. thrill-seeking risk behaviours, reckless risks, rebellious risks and antisocial risks). Personality was conceptualized using the Five-factor Model of personality, a comprehensive trait model of personality. The {ARQ} and the {NEO} Five-factor Inventory were administered to 459 school-based adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. Consistent with past research, younger adolescents and girls generally reported engaging in risk behaviours less frequently than older adolescents and boys. Also, younger adolescents and girls generally rated the {ARQ} behaviours as more risky than their older male counterparts. This was in line with the significant negative correlations found between risk judgements and risk behaviours of all types. Also consistent with past research, few age differences were found for the personality traits. Sex differences were evident, with female adolescents scoring higher on neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness than male adolescents. Together, risk judgements, personality factors, age and sex were found to be significant predictors of risk behaviours; however, the personality factor of significance was found to differ depending upon the risk type. This was also true for age and sex which differed in importance depending upon the risk type. Overall, these factors were most successful in predicting rebellious risk-taking and least successful in predicting thrill-seeking.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of multimodal neuroimaging data are acquired every year worldwide. In order to extract high-dimensional information for computational neuroscience applications standardized data fusion and efficient reduction into integrative data structures are required. Such self-consistent multimodal data sets can be used for computational brain modeling to constrain models with individual measurable features of the brain, such as done with The Virtual Brain ({TVB}). {TVB} is a simulation platform that uses empirical structural and functional data to build full brain models of individual humans. For convenient model construction, we developed a processing pipeline for structural, functional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and optionally electroencephalography ({EEG}) data. The pipeline combines several state-of-the-art neuroinformatics tools to generate subject-specific cortical and subcortical parcellations, surface-tessellations, structural and functional connectomes, lead field matrices, electrical source activity estimates and region-wise aggregated blood oxygen level dependent ({BOLD}) functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) time-series. The output files of the pipeline can be directly uploaded to {TVB} to create and simulate individualized large-scale network models that incorporate intra- and intercortical interaction on the basis of cortical surface triangulations and white matter tractograpy. We detail the pitfalls of the individual processing streams and discuss ways of validation. With the pipeline we also introduce novel ways of estimating the transmission strengths of fiber tracts in whole-brain structural connectivity ({SC}) networks and compare the outcomes of different tractography or parcellation approaches. We tested the functionality of the pipeline on 50 multimodal data sets. In order to quantify the robustness of the connectome extraction part of the pipeline we computed several metrics that quantify its rescan reliability and compared them to other tractography approaches. Together with the pipeline we present several principles to guide future efforts to standardize brain model construction. The code of the pipeline and the fully processed data sets are made available to the public via The Virtual Brain website (thevirtualbrain.org) and via github (https://github.com/{BrainModes}/{TVB}-empirical-data-pipeline). Furthermore, the pipeline can be directly used with High Performance Computing ({HPC}) resources on the Neuroscience Gateway Portal (http://www.nsgportal.org) through a convenient web-interface.},

	abstract = {Social networks affect many aspects of life, including the spread of diseases, the diffusion of information, the workers' productivity, and consumers' behavior. Little is known, however, about how these networks form and change. Estimating causal effects and mechanisms that drive social network formation and dynamics is challenging because of the complexity of engineering social relations in a controlled environment, endogeneity between network structure and individual characteristics, and the lack of time-resolved data about individuals' behavior. We leverage data from a sample of 1.5 million college students on Facebook, who wrote more than 630 million messages and 590 million posts over 4 years, to design a long-term natural experiment of friendship formation and social dynamics in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The analysis shows that affected individuals are more likely to strengthen interactions, while maintaining the same number of friends as unaffected individuals. Our findings suggest that the formation of social relationships may serve as a coping mechanism to deal with high-stress situations and build resilience in communities.},

	abstract = {The human brain undergoes substantial development throughout adolescence and into early adulthood. This maturational process is thought to include the refinement of connectivity between putative connectivity hub regions of the brain, which collectively form a dense core that enhances the functional integration of anatomically distributed, and functionally specialized, neural systems. Here, we used longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to characterize changes in connectivity between 80 cortical and subcortical anatomical regions over a 2 year period in 31 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 years. Connectome-wide analysis indicated that only a small subset of connections showed evidence of statistically significant developmental change over the study period, with 8\% and 6\% of connections demonstrating decreased and increased structural connectivity, respectively. Nonetheless, these connections linked 93\% and 90\% of the 80 regions, respectively, pointing to a selective, yet anatomically distributed pattern of developmental changes that involves most of the brain. Hub regions showed a distinct tendency to be highly connected to each other, indicating robust “rich-club” organization. Moreover, connectivity between hubs was disproportionately influenced by development, such that connectivity between subcortical hubs decreased over time, whereas frontal–subcortical and frontal–parietal hub–hub connectivity increased over time. These findings suggest that late adolescence is characterized by selective, yet significant remodeling of hub–hub connectivity, with the topological organization of hubs shifting emphasis from subcortical hubs in favor of an increasingly prominent role for frontal hub regions.},

	abstract = {Interoception can be broadly defined as the sense of signals originating within the body. As such, interoception is critical for our sense of embodiment, motivation, and well-being. And yet, despite its importance, interoception remains poorly understood within modern science. This paper reviews interdisciplinary perspectives on interoception, with the goal of presenting a unified perspective from diverse fields such as neuroscience, clinical practice, and contemplative studies. It is hoped that this integrative effort will advance our understanding of how interoception determines well-being, and identify the central challenges to such understanding. To this end, we introduce an expanded taxonomy of interoceptive processes, arguing that many of these processes can be understood through an emerging predictive coding model for mind–body integration. The model, which describes the tension between expected and felt body sensation, parallels contemplative theories, and implicates interoception in a variety of affective and psychosomatic disorders. We conclude that maladaptive construal of bodily sensations may lie at the heart of many contemporary maladies, and that contemplative practices may attenuate these interpretative biases, restoring a person’s sense of presence and agency in the world.},

We explore the relationship between α R and αΣ and the reliability of the standardized and unstandardized composite under 3 popular measurement models; we clarify the theoretical meaning of each coefficient and conclude that researchers should choose an appropriate reliability coefficient based on theoretical considerations. We also illustrate that α R and αΣ estimate the reliability of different composite scores, and in most cases cannot be substituted for one another.},

The clusters correspond to periods of grey matter loss and white matter increase observed in developing children, supporting the view that the clusters delineate three key qualitative stages in advancing cognitive capability during the maturation of higher brain systems function.

Correct responses engaged a network comprising left lateral prefrontal cortex, left postcentral gyrus/inferior parietal lobule, striatum, and left cerebellum. In contrast, a similar network was uniquely engaged during errors, but this network was not integrated with activity in regions believed to be engaged for higher-order cognitive control over behavior. A medial/dorsolateral prefrontal-parietal neural network responded to all No-Go stimuli, but with significantly greater activity to errors. {ICA} analyses also identified a third error-related circuit comprised of anterior temporal lobe, limbic, and pregenual cingulate cortices, possibly representing an affective response to errors. There were developmental differences in error-processing activity within many of these neural circuits, typically reflecting greater hemodynamic activation in adults. These findings characterize the spatial structure of neural networks underlying error commission and identify neurobiological differences between adolescents and adults.},

Because such averaging distorts conclusions, we develop and compare hierarchical versions of competing single and dual-process models that account for item variability.

Cognitive development studies on adolescence indicate that this period is characterized by improvements in the performance of existing abilities including speed and capacity of information processing and the ability to have consistent cognitive control of behavior. Although adolescents can behave at adult levels in some ways, brain imaging studies indicate that the functional organization of brain systems that support higher-cognitive processes are not fully mature. Synaptic pruning allows for more efficient local computations, enhancing the ability of discrete brain regions to support high-level cognitive control of behavior including working memory. Myelination increases the speed of neuronal transmission supporting the collaboration of a widely distributed circuitry, integrating regions that support top-down cognitive control of behavior. Functional brain imaging methods allow for the characterization of the relationship between cognitive development and brain maturation as we can map progressions in the establishment of distributed brain circuitry and its relation to enhanced cognitive control of behavior. We present a review on the maturation (as distinct from "development" in emphasizing the transition to maturity and stabilization) of response inhibition, brain structure, and brain function through adolescence. We also propose a model for brain-behavior maturation that allows for the qualitative changes in cognitive processes that occur during adolescence.},

Two studies are reported, one of sharing in 18- and 24-month-olds (n = 29) and one of instrumental and empathy-based helping in 18- and 30-month-olds (n = 62). In both studies, parents read age-appropriate picture books to their children, and the content and structure of their emotion-related and internal state discourse were coded. Results showed that children who helped and shared more quickly and more often, especially in tasks that required more complex emotion understanding, had parents who more often asked them to label and explain the emotions depicted in the books. Moreover, it was parents’ elicitation of children’s talk about emotions rather than parents’ own production of emotion labels and explanations that explained children’s prosocial behavior, even after controlling for age. Thus, it is the quality, not the quantity, of parents’ talk about emotions with their toddlers that matters for early prosocial behavior.},

Results were largely consistent with theory. Parents' use of inductive as opposed to power-assertive discipline was related to children's prosocial behavior. Children of inductive parents were more empathic; and more empathic children were more prosocial. Moreover, children's empathy was found to mediate the relation between parents' discipline and children's prosocial behavior. Few relations were obtained for children's guilt indices, but post hoc analyses yielded theoretically consistent results. Contrary to expectations, parents' use of statements of disappointment was the component of the inductive discipline score which was most strongly related to children's prosocial behavior.},

Findings were consistent with those previously obtained on acutely sleep-deprived adults. Our data suggest that, when asked to maintain attention and burdened by chronic sleep restriction, the adolescent brain responds via compensatory mechanisms that accentuate the typical activation patterns of attention-relevant brain regions. Specifically, it appeared that regions that are normally active during an attention-demanding working memory task in the well-rested brain became even more active to maintain performance after chronic sleep restriction. In contrast, regions in which activity is normally suppressed during such a task in the well-rested brain showed even greater suppression to maintain performance after chronic sleep restriction. Although limited by the small sample, study results provide important evidence of feasibility, as well as guidance for future research into the functional neurological effects of chronic sleep restriction in general, the effects of sleep restriction in children and adolescents, and the neuroscience of attention and its disorders in children.},

Thirty-seven participants (7-29 years of age) were scanned using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging and a paradigm that parametrically manipulated reward values. The results show exaggerated accumbens activity, relative to prefrontal activity in adolescents, compared with children and adults, which appeared to be driven by different time courses of development for these regions. Accumbens activity in adolescents looked like that of adults in both extent of activity and sensitivity to reward values, although the magnitude of activity was exaggerated. In contrast, the extent of orbital frontal cortex activity in adolescents looked more like that of children than adults, with less focal patterns of activity. These findings suggest that maturing subcortical systems become disproportionately activated relative to later maturing top-down control systems, biasing the adolescent's action toward immediate over long-term gains.},

The mechanisms underlying this process are thought to be an age-related decrease in activation extent as well as an increased magnitude in task-related areas. The present study aimed to evaluate these notions while controlling for confounders that may bias towards focalization. We used adolescent subjects in small age ranges. In addition, head motion corrections were incorporated in statistical analyses and regions of interest were identified for each participant separately to overcome inter-individual variability in anatomy and functional organization. Activation patterns of 13-, 17- and 21-year-old males were compared during the decision phase of a challenging and complex gambling paradigm. The {BOLD} amplitude enhanced with increasing age, modulated by task conditions. First, response amplitude during difficult, endogenous relative to exogenous decisions increased with age. This decision difficulty effect was most pronounced in 21-year-olds, both in areas associated with task execution and default mode areas. Second, deciding to pass as opposed to gamble exerted more effort in inferior frontal and parietal areas only by 13- and 17-year-olds. There was neither an age-related decrease in activation extent, nor any qualitative shifts in activated areas as suggested by the focalization hypothesis. These results suggest that although different age groups throughout adolescence engage similar brain areas during decision making, the response magnitude in these areas increases with age particularly during difficult task conditions, providing that confounding factors are controlled.},

In contrast, exposure to positive behavior across own and an unfamiliar mother (controlling for neutral behavior) was associated with superior temporal sulcus, occipital pole, amygdala and striatum activity. Adolescent depressive symptoms were associated with reduced rostral anterior cingulate activity during exposure to one's own (compared to an unfamiliar) mother's positive behavior, and reduced striatal activity during exposure to positive behavior in general.

{METHODS}: The present study used functional neuroimaging to assess the degree to which adolescents and adults differ in patterns of neuronal engagement during implicit encoding of affective stimuli. Subjects underwent rapid event-related {fMRI} while viewing faces with angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. A surprise post-scan memory test was administered.
{RESULTS}: Consistent with previous findings, both adolescents and adults displayed engagement of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex when viewing subsequently recognized stimuli. Age differences emerged in patterns of neuronal activation associated with subsequent recognition of specific face-emotion types. Relative to adults, adolescents displayed more activity in the anterior cingulate when viewing subsequently remembered angry faces, and more activity in the right temporal pole when viewing subsequently remembered fear faces. Conversely, adults displayed more activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate when viewing subsequently remembered happy faces and more activity in the right posterior hippocampus when viewing subsequently remembered neutral faces. These age-related differences emerged in the absence of differences in behavioral performance.

In the present study, a cross-sectional design was used with healthy children (n=7), adolescents (n= 12), and adults (n= 10) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) during a task that required perceiving fearful faces. Males and females differed in the asymmetry of activation of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex across the three age groups. For males, activation within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was bilateral in children, right lateralized in adolescents, and bilateral in adults, whereas females showed a monotonic relationship with age, with older females showing more bilateral activation than younger ones. In contrast, amygdala activation was similar for both sexes, with bilateral activation in children, right-lateralized activation in adolescents, and bilateral activation in adults. These results suggest that males and females show different patterns of lateralized cortical and subcortical brain activation across the period of development from childhood through early adulthood.},

Here, during functional magnetic resonance imaging, healthy adolescents and adults performed a modified antisaccade task in which trial-by-trial reward contingencies were manipulated. The use of a novel fast, event-related design enabled developmental differences in brain function underlying temporally distinct stages of reward processing and response inhibition to be assessed. Reward trials compared with neutral trials resulted in faster correct inhibitory responses across ages and in fewer inhibitory errors in adolescents. During reward trials, the blood oxygen level-dependent signal was attenuated in the ventral striatum in adolescents during cue assessment, then overactive during response preparation, suggesting limitations during adolescence in reward assessment and heightened reactivity in anticipation of reward compared with adults. Importantly, heightened activity in the frontal cortex along the precentral sulcus was also observed in adolescents during reward-trial response preparation, suggesting reward modulation of oculomotor control regions supporting correct inhibitory responding. Collectively, this work characterizes specific immaturities in adolescent brain systems that support reward processing and describes the influence of reward on inhibitory control. In sum, our findings suggest mechanisms that may underlie adolescents' vulnerability to poor decision-making and risk-taking behavior.},

Related findings suggest that face-emotion processing engages the amygdala within an interconnected circuitry that can be studied using a functional-connectivity approach. Past work also underscores important functional changes in the amygdala during development. Taken together, prior research on amygdala function and development reveals a need for more work examining developmental changes in the amygdala's response to fearful faces and in amygdala functional connectivity during face processing. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare 31 adolescents (9–17 years old) and 30 adults (21–40 years old) on activation to fearful faces in the amygdala and other regions implicated in face processing. Moreover, these data were used to compare patterns of amygdala functional connectivity in adolescents and adults. During passive viewing, adolescents demonstrated greater amygdala and fusiform activation to fearful faces than did adults. Functional connectivity analysis revealed stronger connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus in adults than in adolescents. Within each group, variability in age did not correlate with amygdala response, and sex-related developmental differences in amygdala response were not found. Eye movement data collected outside of the magnetic resonance imaging scanner using the same task suggested that developmental differences in amygdala activation were not attributable to differences in eye-gaze patterns. Amygdala hyperactivation in response to fearful faces may explain increased vulnerability to affective disorders in adolescence; stronger amygdala-hippocampus connectivity in adults than adolescents may reflect maturation in learning or habituation to facial expressions.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The onset of adolescence is a time of dramatic changes, including changes in sleep, and a time of new health concerns related to increases in risk-taking, sensation seeking, depression, substance use, and accidents. As part of a larger study examining puberty-specific changes in adolescents' reward-related brain function, the current article focuses on the relationship between functional neuroimaging measures of reward and measures of sleep.
{METHODS}: A total of 58 healthy participants 11-13 years of age completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan using a guessing task with monetary rewards and 4 days of at-home actigraphy and self-reported sleep ratings. Sleep variables included actigraph measures of mean weekend minutes asleep, sleep onset time, and sleep offset time, as well as self-reported sleep quality.
{RESULTS}: During reward anticipation, less activation in the caudate (part of the ventral striatum) was associated with fewer minutes asleep, later sleep onset time, and lower sleep quality. During reward outcome, less caudate activation was associated with later sleep onset time, earlier sleep offset time, and lower sleep quality.
{CONCLUSIONS}: It has been hypothesized that adolescents' low reactivity in reward-related brain areas could lead to compensatory increases in reward-driven behavior. This study's findings suggest that sleep could contribute to such behavior. Because decreased sleep has been associated with risky behavior and negative mood, these findings raise concerns about a negative spiral whereby the effects of puberty and sleep deprivation may have synergistic effects on reward processing, contributing to adolescent behavioral and emotional health problems.},

	abstract = {Adolescent risk-taking is a public health issue that increases the odds of poor lifetime outcomes. One factor thought to influence adolescents' propensity for risk-taking is an enhanced sensitivity to appetitive cues, relative to an immature capacity to exert sufficient cognitive control. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing interactions among ventral striatal, dorsal striatal, and prefrontal cortical regions with varying appetitive load using {fMRI} scanning. Child, teen, and adult participants performed a go/no-go task with appetitive (happy faces) and neutral cues (calm faces). Impulse control to neutral cues showed linear improvement with age, whereas teens showed a nonlinear reduction in impulse control to appetitive cues. This performance decrement in teens was paralleled by enhanced activity in the ventral striatum. Prefrontal cortical recruitment correlated with overall accuracy and showed a linear response with age for no-go versus go trials. Connectivity analyses identified a ventral frontostriatal circuit including the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal striatum during no-go versus go trials. Examining recruitment developmentally showed that teens had greater between-subject ventral-dorsal striatal coactivation relative to children and adults for happy no-go versus go trials. These findings implicate exaggerated ventral striatal representation of appetitive cues in adolescents relative to an intermediary cognitive control response. Connectivity and coactivity data suggest these systems communicate at the level of the dorsal striatum differentially across development. Biased responding in this system is one possible mechanism underlying heightened risk-taking during adolescence.},

	abstract = {The left inferior frontal gyrus ({LIFG}) has consistently been associated with both phonologic and semantic operations in functional neuroimaging studies. Two main theories have proposed a different functional organization in the {LIFG} for these processes. One theory suggests an anatomic parcellation of phonologic and semantic operations within the {LIFG}. An alternative theory proposes that both processes are encompassed within a supramodal executive function in a single region in the {LIFG}. To test these theories, we carried out a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies employing phonologic and semantic verbal fluency tasks. Seventeen articles meeting our pre-established criteria were found, consisting of 22 relevant experiments with 197 healthy subjects and a total of 41 peak activations in the {LIFG}. We determined 95\% confidence intervals of the mean location (x, y, and z coordinates) of peaks of blood oxygenation level-dependent ({BOLD}) responses from published phonologic and semantic verbal fluency studies using the nonparametric technique of bootstrap analysis. Significant differences were revealed in dorsal–ventral (z-coordinate) localizations of the peak {BOLD} response: phonologic verbal fluency peak {BOLD} response was significantly more dorsal to the peak associated with semantic verbal fluency (confidence interval of difference: 1.9–17.4 mm). No significant differences were evident in antero–posterior (x-coordinate) or medial–lateral (y-coordinate) positions. The results support distinct dorsal–ventral locations for phonologic and semantic processes within the {LIFG}.

	abstract = {Developmental functional imaging studies of cognitive control show progressive age-related increase in task-relevant fronto-striatal activation in male development from childhood to adulthood. Little is known, however, about how gender affects this functional development. In this study, we used event related functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine effects of sex, age, and their interaction on brain activation during attentional switching and interference inhibition, in 63 male and female adolescents and adults, aged 13 to 38. Linear age correlations were observed across all subjects in task-specific frontal, striatal and temporo-parietal activation. Gender analysis revealed increased activation in females relative to males in fronto-striatal areas during the Switch task, and laterality effects in the Simon task, with females showing increased left inferior prefrontal and temporal activation, and males showing increased right inferior prefrontal and parietal activation. Increased prefrontal activation clusters in females and increased parietal activation clusters in males furthermore overlapped with clusters that were age-correlated across the whole group, potentially reflecting more mature prefrontal brain activation patterns for females, and more mature parietal activation patterns for males. Gender by age interactions further supported this dissociation, revealing exclusive female-specific age correlations in inferior and medial prefrontal brain regions during both tasks, and exclusive male-specific age correlations in superior parietal (Switch task) and temporal regions (Simon task). These findings show increased recruitment of age-correlated prefrontal activation in females, and of age-correlated parietal activation in males, during tasks of cognitive control. Gender differences in frontal and parietal recruitment may thus be related to gender differences in the neurofunctional maturation of these brain regions.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Personality and alcohol expectancies have been examined as risk factors for the initiation and maintenance of alcohol use in adolescents and young adults. Differences in processing appetitive stimuli are seen as a mechanism for personality's influence on behavior, and that mechanism predisposes individuals to form more positive expectancies for alcohol. The go/no-go task has been used to show how personality differences influence responding to appetitive stimuli in adolescents and adults, and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) has been used to examine the relation of go/no-go responding to personality in adult males. However, no study to date has examined the relation between {fMRI} responding, personality and alcohol expectancies in adolescents.
{METHOD}: Forty-six adolescents (ages 12-14 years; 61\% male) with minimal substance use histories completed measures of neuroticism, extraversion, and alcohol expectancies, and performed a go/no-go task during {fMRI} acquisition.
{RESULTS}: Greater blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) response to inhibition predicted fewer expectancies of cognitive and motor improvements but more expectancies of cognitive and motor impairment from alcohol. In addition, extraverted youths reported more positive alcohol expectancies. However, {BOLD} response did not predict neuroticism or extraversion.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These preliminary results suggest that decreased inhibitory neural processing may contribute to more positive and less negative expectancies, which can eventually lead to problem drinking. Further, extraversion may also yield more positive expectancies and could underlie a vulnerability to disordered alcohol use.},

Previous studies have shown that while time perception develops early in life, interference control seems to follow a protracted course of maturation into late adolescence. Thus, the current study examined developmental changes in neural activation and functional interaction between brain regions during a combined time discrimination and interference control task using {fMRI}. Thirty-four participants, aged 8-15 years, were scanned while performing a spatial stimulus response compatibility ({SRC}) task and a time discrimination ({TD}) task using identical stimuli. We found shared neural activation in a fronto-parieto-cerebellar network as well as task-specific patterns of psychophysiological interaction with positive coupling between the right inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}), the superior parietal lobes bilaterally, the contralateral {IFG} and the thalamus during interference control and positive interactions between the right {IFG} and bilateral cerebellar activity and the thalamus during time discrimination. Developmental changes in task performance and brain activation patterns were only observed during the {SRC} task, with increased neural activity in the left inferior parietal gyrus and positive coupling between fronto-parietal brain regions that was only observed in the adolescents group. These results suggest that although both cognitive tasks rely on a shared neural network, distinct developmental curves of brain activation and connectivity could be observed associated with differential maturation patterns underlying cognitive development.},

A positive correlation was observed between age and Stroop-related activation (n = 30) in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, the left anterior cingulate, and the left parietal and parieto-occipital cortices. No regions showed a negative correlation between activation and age. We further investigated age-related differences by stratifying the sample into three age groups: children (ages 7-11), adolescents (ages 12-16), and young adults (ages 18-22). Young adult subjects (n = 11) displayed significant activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri bilaterally, the left anterior cingulate, and bilateral inferior and superior parietal lobules. Between-group comparisons revealed that young adults had significantly greater activation than adolescent subjects (n = 11) in the left middle frontal gyrus and that young adults showed significantly greater activation than children (n = 8) in the anterior cingulate and left parietal and parieto-occipital regions, as well as in the left middle frontal gyrus. Compared to children, both adult and adolescent subjects exhibited significantly greater activation in the parietal cortex. Adult and adolescent groups, however, did not differ in activation for this region. Together, these data suggest that Stroop task-related functional development of the parietal lobe occurs by adolescence. In contrast, prefrontal cortex function contributing to the Stroop interference task continues to develop into adulthood. This neuromaturational process may depend on increased ability to recruit focal neural resources with age. Findings from this study, the first developmental {fMRI} investigation of the Stroop interference task, provide a template with which normal development and neurodevelopmental disorders of prefrontal cortex function can be assessed.},

Ten healthy adolescents performed an emotional oddball task. Subjects detected infrequent circles (targets) within a continual stream of phase-scrambled images (standards). Sad and neutral images were intermittently presented as task-irrelevant distracters (novels). As previously shown for adults, when the adolescents responded to the task-relevant targets, activation increased in the dorsal attention-executive system including the anterior middle frontal gyrus ({aMFG}), dorsal anterior cingulate ({ACG}), posterior cingulate ({PCG}), insula, and supramarginal gyrus ({SMG}). Unlike adults, however, the adolescents exhibited strong activation to the emotional distracter images not only in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({VmPFC}), but also in the posterior middle frontal gyrus ({pMFG}) and in the parietal cortex. Those subjects who had stronger {VmPFC} activation to emotional distraction also had reduced activation in the {aMFG} during target detection, suggesting that emotional information may interfere with executive processing in these adolescents. In contrast, {pMFG} and {PCG} activation to emotional distracters was positively correlated with {aMFG} activation to targets, indicating a different role of these regions from the {VmPFC}. The pattern of activation to task-irrelevant emotional distraction suggests a possible immaturity of brain function in cognitive control over emotional distraction in adolescents.},

The relatively scarce developmental functional imaging literature on cognitive control, however, has been inconsistent with respect to the neurofunctional substrates of this cognitive development, finding either increased or decreased executive prefrontal function in the progression from childhood to adulthood. Such inconsistencies may be due to small subject numbers or confounds from age-related performance differences in block design functional {MRI} ({fMRI}). In this study, rapid, randomized, mixed-trial event-related {fMRI} was used to investigate developmental differences of the neural networks mediating a range of motor and cognitive inhibition functions in a sizeable number of adolescents and adults. Functional brain activation was compared between adolescents and adults during three different executive tasks measuring selective motor response inhibition (Go/no-go task), cognitive interference inhibition (Simon task), and attentional set shifting (Switch task). Adults compared with children showed increased brain activation in task-specific frontostriatal networks, including right orbital and mesial prefrontal cortex and caudate during the Go/no-go task, right mesial and inferior prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and putamen during the Switch task and left dorsolateral and inferior frontotemporoparietal regions and putamen during the Simon task. Whole-brain regression analyses with age across all subjects showed progressive age-related changes in similar and extended clusters of task-specific frontostriatal, frontotemporal, and frontoparietal networks. The findings suggest progressive maturation of task-specific frontostriatal and frontocortical networks for cognitive control functions in the transition from childhood to mid-adulthood.},

Evidence from developmental neuroscience suggests that this heightened emotionality occurs, in part, due to a peak in functional reactivity to rewarding stimuli, which renders adolescents more oriented toward reward-seeking behaviors. Most prior work has focused on how reward sensitivity may create vulnerabilities, leading to increases in risk taking. Here, we test whether heightened reward sensitivity may potentially be an asset for adolescents when engaged in prosocial activities. Thirty-two adolescents were followed over a one-year period to examine whether ventral striatum activation to prosocial rewards predicts decreases in risk taking over a year. Results show that heightened ventral striatum activation to prosocial stimuli relates to longitudinal declines in risk taking. Therefore, the very same neural region that has conferred vulnerability for adolescent risk taking may also be protective against risk taking.},

However, it is not clear to what extent the responsible brain mechanisms are similar to those invoked in cognitive control in a non-emotional context. The aim of this study was to compare the neural circuitry of cognitive and emotional interference resolution in healthy adolescents, employing variants of the counting Stroop task. Cognitive and emotional interference processing engaged predominantly brain regions belonging to the dorsal- and the ventral attentional systems, respectively, and commonly the inferior frontal gyrus, {IFG} (Broca's area, left {BA} 45, but also right {BA} 45). These results suggest that {BA} 45 is a bridge of interaction between the dorsal- and the ventral attentional systems implicated in top-down orienting of attention and, respectively, in bottom-up processing of salient stimuli. Reaction time data showed that some participants tend to respond faster, while others respond slower to negative emotional compared to neutral trials. The emotional interference maps revealed that fast responders recruit the right temporo-parietal junction and to a larger extent the right {BA} 45 and the bilateral cuneus, suggesting that they engage more efficient cognitive control mechanisms to override the attentional bias. No anterior cingulate ({ACC}) activation was observed in either cognitive, or emotional interference; this supports the view that {ACC} is not involved specifically in mediating Stroop selection.},

While expecting unpleasant stimuli, the “cognitive control” group showed higher activity in left medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas but reduced activity in the left extended amygdala, pulvinar/lateral geniculate nucleus and fusiform gyrus. Cognitive control during the “unknown” expectation was associated with reduced amygdalar activity as well and further with reduced insular and thalamic activity. The amygdala activations associated with cognitive control correlated negatively with the reappraisal scores of an emotion regulation questionnaire. The results indicate that cognitive control of particularly unpleasant emotions is associated with elevated prefrontal cortex activity that may serve to attenuate emotion processing in for instance amygdala, and, notably, in perception related brain areas.},

Delayed maturation of cortical structures during the adolescent years has been proposed as a possible explanation for this observation. Here, we test the hypothesis of adolescent delayed maturation by using {fMRI} during a monetary decision-making task that directly examines risk-taking behavior during choice selection. Orbitofrontal/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({OFC}/{VLPFC}) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) were examined selectively since both have been implicated in reward-related processes, cognitive control, and resolution of conflicting decisions. Group comparisons revealed greater activation in the {OFC}/{VLPFC} ({BA} 47) and dorsal {ACC} ({BA} 32) in adults than adolescents when making risky selections. Furthermore, reduced activity in these areas correlated with greater risk-taking performance in adolescents and in the combined group. Consistent with predictions, these results suggest that adolescents engage prefrontal regulatory structures to a lesser extent than adults when making risky economic choices.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a time when the ability to engage cognitive control is linked to crucial life outcomes. Despite a historical focus on prefrontal cortex functioning, recent evidence suggests that differences between individuals may relate to interactions between distributed brain regions that collectively form a cognitive control network ({CCN}). Other research points to a spatially distinct and functionally antagonistic system--the default-mode network ({DMN})--which typically deactivates during performance of control tasks. This literature implies that individual differences in cognitive control are determined either by activation or functional connectivity of {CCN} regions, deactivation or functional connectivity of {DMN} regions, or some combination of both. We tested between these possibilities using a multilevel {fMRI} characterization of {CCN} and {DMN} dynamics, measured during performance of a cognitive control task and during a task-free resting state, in 73 human adolescents. Better cognitive control performance was associated with (1) reduced activation of {CCN} regions, but not deactivation of the {DMN}; (2) variations in task-related, but not resting-state, functional connectivity within a distributed network involving both the {CCN} and {DMN}; (3) functional segregation of core elements of these two systems; and (4) task-dependent functional integration of a set of peripheral nodes into either one network or the other in response to prevailing stimulus conditions. These results indicate that individual differences in adolescent cognitive control are not solely attributable to the functioning of any single region or network, but are instead dependent on a dynamic and context-dependent interplay between the {CCN} and {DMN}.},

	abstract = {Cognitive control is necessary to flexibly act in changing environments. Sequence processing is needed in language comprehension to build the syntactic structure in sentences. Functional imaging studies suggest that sequence processing engages the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({PFC}). In contrast, cognitive control processes additionally recruit bilateral rostral lateral {PFC} regions. The present study aimed to investigate these two types of processes in one experimental paradigm. Sequence processing was manipulated using two different sequencing rules varying in complexity. Cognitive control was varied with different cue-sets that determined the choice of a sequencing rule. Univariate analyses revealed distinct {PFC} regions for the two types of processing (i.e. sequence processing: left ventrolateral {PFC} and cognitive control processing: bilateral dorsolateral and rostral {PFC}). Moreover, in a common brain network (including left lateral {PFC} and intraparietal sulcus) no interaction between sequence and cognitive control processing was observed. In contrast, a multivariate pattern analysis revealed an interaction of sequence and cognitive control processing, such that voxels in left lateral {PFC} and parietal cortex showed different tuning functions for tasks involving different sequencing and cognitive control demands. These results suggest that the difference between the process of rule selection (i.e. cognitive control) and the process of rule-based sequencing (i.e. sequence processing) find their neuronal underpinnings in distinct activation patterns in lateral {PFC}. Moreover, the combination of rule selection and rule sequencing can shape the response of neurons in lateral {PFC} and parietal cortex.},

In the present study we used {fMRI} to investigate the role of dopaminergic genetic variation on executive functioning by comparing how activation associated with successful and unsuccessful inhibitions differs based on {DAT}1-genotype and {ADHD}-diagnosis in adolescents performing a go/nogo task. The results identify regional specificity concerning which functional differences can be attributed to the possession of the high risk {DAT}1 genotype, the clinical condition or an interaction between the two. During response inhibition, individuals with two copies of the 10-repeat allele showed increased activation in frontal, medial, and parietal regions, which may indicate that inhibition is more effortful for this group. Conversely, this group displayed a reduced error response in the parahippocampal gyrus, suggestive of reduced learning from errors. There were also a number of frontal, parietal, medial and occipital regions, where the relationship between genotype and {fMRI}-activation differed between the {ADHD} group and the typically developing adolescents. Finally, the {ADHD} group displayed decreased activation in parietal and (pre)frontal regions during response inhibition, and in frontal and medial brain regions on error trials.},

Because the ability to perceive subtle facial signals communicating sadness is an important aspect of prosocial development, and is critical for empathic behavior, we examined this phenomenon from a developmental perspective using a backward masking paradigm. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), 10 healthy adolescent children were presented with a series of happy and sad facial expressions, each lasting 20 ms and masked immediately by a neutral face to prevent conscious awareness of the affective expression. Relative to fixation baseline, masked sad faces activated the right amygdala, whereas masked happy faces failed to activate any of the regions of interest. Direct comparison between masked happy and sad faces revealed valence specific differences in the anterior cingulate gyrus. When the data were compared statistically to our previous sample of adults, the adolescent group showed significantly greater activity in the right amygdala relative to the adults during the masked sad condition. Groups also differed in several non-hypothesized regions. Development of unconscious perception from adolescence into adulthood appears to be accompanied by reduced activity within limbic affect processing systems, and perhaps increased involvement of other cortical and cerebellar systems.},

Adolescents (n = 31) preformed a Decision-Reward Uncertainty task that separates decision uncertainty into behavioral and reward risk, while they were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral risk trials involved uncertainty about which action to perform to earn a fixed monetary reward. In contrast, during reward risk the decision that might lead to a reward was known, but the likelihood of earning a reward was probabilistically determined. Behavioral risk trials evoked greater activation than the reward risk and no risk conditions in the anterior cingulate, medial frontal gyrus, bilateral frontal poles, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, precuneus, bilateral superior-middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and insula. Our results were similar to those of young adults using the same task (Huettel, 2006) except that adolescents did not show significant activation in the posterior supramarginal gyrus during behavioral risk. During the behavioral risk condition regardless of reward outcome, overall mean frontal pole activity showed a positive correlation with age during the behavioral and reward risk conditions suggesting a developmental difference of this region of interest. Additionally, reward response to the Decision-Reward Uncertainty task in adolescents was similar to that seen in young adults (Huettel, 2006). Our data did not show a correlation between age and mean ventral striatum activity during the three conditions. While our results came from a healthy high functioning non-maltreated sample of adolescents, this method can be used to address types of risks and reward processing in children and adolescents with predisposing vulnerabilities and add to the paucity of imaging studies of risk and reward processing during adolescence.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Adolescent risk-taking, including behaviors resulting in injury or death, has been attributed in part to maturational differences in mesolimbic incentive-motivational neurocircuitry, including ostensible oversensitivity of the nucleus accumbens ({NAcc}) to rewards.
{METHODOLOGY}/{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: To test whether adolescents showed increased {NAcc} activation by cues for rewards, or by delivery of rewards, we scanned 24 adolescents (age 12-17) and 24 adults age (22-42) with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a monetary incentive delay ({MID}) task. The {MID} task was configured to temporally disentangle potential reward or potential loss anticipation-related brain signal from reward or loss notification-related signal. Subjects saw cues signaling opportunities to win or avoid losing \$0, \$.50, or \$5 for responding quickly to a subsequent target. Subjects then viewed feedback of their trial success after a variable interval from cue presentation of between 6 to 17 s. Adolescents showed reduced {NAcc} recruitment by reward-predictive cues compared to adult controls in a linear contrast with non-incentive cues, and in a volume-of-interest analysis of signal change in the {NAcc}. In contrast, adolescents showed little difference in striatal and frontocortical responsiveness to reward deliveries compared to adults.
{CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: In light of divergent developmental difference findings between neuroimaging incentive paradigms (as well as at different stages within the same task), these data suggest that maturational differences in incentive-motivational neurocircuitry: 1) may be sensitive to nuances of incentive tasks or stimuli, such as behavioral or learning contingencies, and 2) may be specific to the component of the instrumental behavior (such as anticipation versus notification).},

	abstract = {Very little is known about the neurobiological correlates of reward processing during social decision-making in the developing brain and whether prior social and moral information (reputations) modulates reward responses in youth as has been demonstrated in adults. Moreover, although externalizing behavior problems in youth are associated with deficits in reward processing and social cognition, a real-life social interaction paradigm using functional neuroimaging ({fMRI}) has not yet been applied to probe reward processing in such youth. Functional neuroimaging was used to examine the neural correlates of reward-related decision-making during a trust task in two samples of age-matched 11 to 16-year-old boys: with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) externalizing behavior problems. The task required subjects to decide whether to share or keep monetary rewards from partners they themselves identified during a real-life peer sociometric procedure as interpersonally aggressive or kind (vs. neutral). Results supported the notion that prior social and moral information (reputations) modulated reward responses in the adolescent brain. Moreover, boys with externalizing problems showed differential activation in the bilateral insula during the decision phase of the game as well as the caudate and anterior insula during the outcome phase of the game. Similar activation in adolescents in response to reward related stimuli as found in adults suggests some developmental continuity in corticostriatal circuits. Group differences are interpreted with caution given the small group sizes in the current study. Notwithstanding this limitation, the study provides preliminary evidence for anomalous reward responses in boys with externalizing behavior problems, thereby providing a possible biological correlate of well-established social-cognitive and reward-related theories of externalizing behavior disorders.},

In the delay task, superior performance in adults was paralleled by a significantly increased power of response in a network comprising prefrontal and parietal cortical regions and putamen.

To examine whether individual differences in psychosocial and behavioral symptomatology relate to activation of motivational neurocircuitry, we scanned 26 psychiatrically healthy adolescents using {fMRI} as they performed a monetary incentive delay task. Overall Problem Density on the Drug Use Screening Inventory ({DUSI}-{OPD}) correlated positively with activation of ventral mesofrontal cortex ({mFC}) during anticipation of responding for rewards (vs responding for no incentive). In addition, {DUSI}-{OPD} correlated positively with right ventral striatum recruitment during anticipation of responding to win rewards (vs responding for no incentive or to avoid losses of identical magnitudes). Finally, a psychophysiological interaction ({PPI}) analysis indicated that increased connectivity between nucleus accumbens and portions of anterior cingulate and {mFC} as a function of reward prospects also correlated with {DUSI}-{OPD}.

We tested this hypothesis with {fMRI} using a gambling task in which participants chose between Low-Risk gambles with a high probability of obtaining a small reward (1 Euro) and High-Risk gambles with a smaller probability of obtaining a higher reward (2, 4, 6, or 8 Euro).

High-Risk choices increased with rewards for all ages, but risk-taking decreased with age for low reward gambles. The {fMRI} results confirmed that High-Risk choices were associated with activation in {VMPFC}, whereas Low-Risk choices were associated with activation in lateral {PFC}. Activation in dorsal {ACC} showed a linear decrease with age, whereas activation in {VMPFC} and {VS} showed an inverted U-shaped developmental pattern, with a peak in adolescence. In addition, behavioral differences in risk-taking propensity modulated brain activation in all age groups.

Age-related activation decreases were observed within more posterior regions including posterior cingulate, insula and posterior cerebellar cortices, presumably mediating visual-spatial saliency detection. The effect of reward on sustained attention networks was associated with increased activation with age in regions associated with both executive attention control and reward processing, including dorsolateral, inferior and ventromedial prefrontal cortices ({PFC}), striatum, and temporo-parietal regions, suggestive of greater integration and executive control of motivation and cognition with maturity. Activation in paralimbic posterior cingulate and inferior temporal brain regions of visual-spatial saliency processing was progressively reduced in activation with increasing development. Thus, with increasing development between adolescence and adulthood, reward appears to enhance maturing cognitive sustained attention and executive reward-processing networks, whilst reducing paralimbic regions of saliency detection. These findings may be the neural underpinnings for the progressive maturation of motivational control over risk taking behaviours between adolescence and adulthood.},

	abstract = {The right posterior superior temporal sulcus ({pSTS}) is a neural region involved in assessing the goals and intentions underlying the motion of social agents. Recent research has identified visual cues, such as chasing, that trigger animacy detection and intention attribution. When readily available in a visual display, these cues reliably activate the {pSTS}. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined if attributing intentions to random motion would likewise engage the {pSTS}. Participants viewed displays of four moving circles and were instructed to search for chasing or mirror-correlated motion. On chasing trials, one circle chased another circle, invoking the percept of an intentional agent; while on correlated motion trials, one circle’s motion was mirror reflected by another. On the remaining trials, all circles moved randomly. As expected, {pSTS} activation was greater when participants searched for chasing vs correlated motion when these cues were present in the displays. Of critical importance, {pSTS} activation was also greater when participants searched for chasing compared to mirror-correlated motion when the displays in both search conditions were statistically identical random motion. We conclude that {pSTS} activity associated with intention attribution can be invoked by top–down processes in the absence of reliable visual cues for intentionality.},

	abstract = {The relation between brain development across adolescence and adolescent risky behavior has attracted increasing interest in recent years. It has been proposed that adolescents are hypersensitive to reward because of an imbalance in the developmental pattern followed by the striatum and prefrontal cortex. To date, it is unclear if adolescents engage in risky behavior because they overestimate potential rewards or respond more to received rewards and whether these effects occur in the absence of decisions. In this study, we used a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm that allowed us to dissociate effects of the anticipation, receipt, and omission of reward in 10- to 12-year-old, 14- to 15-year-old, and 18- to 23-year-old participants. We show that in anticipation of uncertain outcomes, the anterior insula is more active in adolescents compared with young adults and that the ventral striatum shows a reward-related peak in middle adolescence, whereas young adults show orbitofrontal cortex activation to omitted reward. These regions show distinct developmental trajectories. This study supports the hypothesis that adolescents are hypersensitive to reward and adds to the current literature in demonstrating that neural activation differs in adolescents even for small rewards in the absence of choice. These findings may have important implications for understanding adolescent risk-taking behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper assessed the neural systems involved in processing of dynamic facial expressions in adolescents. The processing of facial expressions changes as a function of age, and it is thus important to understand how healthy adolescent subjects process dynamic facial expressions prior to analyzing disease-related changes. We hypothesized that viewing of dynamic facial expressions with opposing valences (happy vs. fearful) induces differential activations and deactivations in the brain. 27 healthy adolescents (9 female, 18 male, mean age = 14.5 years; age range 11.6-17.3 years) were examined by using the {ASSQ} and K-{SADS}-{PL} and scanned with 1.5-T {fMRI} during viewing of dynamic facial expressions and mosaic control images. The stimuli activated the same areas as previously seen in dynamic facial expression in adults. Our results indicated that opposing-valence dynamic facial expressions had differential effects on many cortical structures but not on subcortical limbic structures. The mirror neuron system is activated more during viewing of fearful compared to happy expressions in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}) and superior temporal sulcus ({STS}) left dominantly. We also detected more deactivation in the ventral anterior cingulate gyrus ({ACG}), showing more automated attentional processing of fearful expressions during passive viewing. Females were found to deactivate the right frontal pole more than male adolescents during happy facial expressions, while there were no differences in fear processing between genders. No clear gender or age effects were detected. In conclusion fear induces stronger responses in attention and mirror neurons probably related to fear contagion.},

Priors that express psychologically meaningful intuitions damp out random fluctuations in the data due to sampling variability, without sacrificing flexibility. This article focuses on how an intuitively satisfying informative prior distribution can be constructed. In particular, it demonstrates how the hierarchical introduction of a parameterized generative account of the set of models under consideration naturally imposes a non-uniform prior distribution over the models, encoding existing intuitions about the models. The hierarchical approach for constructing informative model priors is made concrete using a worked example, the Varying Abstraction Model ({VAM}), a family of categorization models including and expanding the exemplar and prototype models. It is shown how psychological intuitions about the relative plausibilities of the models in the {VAM} can be formally captured in an informative prior distribution over these models, by specifying a theoretically informed process for generating the models in the {VAM}. The smoothing effect of the informative prior in estimation is demonstrated by considering ten previously published data sets from the category learning literature.},

In practical applications of {CPT}, the model’s parameters are usually estimated using a single-participant maximum likelihood approach. The present study shows the advantages of an alternative, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation procedure. Performance of the procedure is illustrated with a parameter recovery study and application to a real data set. The work reveals that without particular constraints on the parameter space, {CPT} can produce loss aversion without the parameter that has traditionally been associated with loss aversion.

It quantifies the relations between observed inputs and outputs that are connected through a set of latent state variables. State space models are used to investigate the dynamical properties of these latent quantities. These models are especially of interest in the study of emotion dynamics, with the system representing the evolving emotion components of an individual. However, for simultaneous modeling of individual and population differences, a hierarchical extension of the basic state space model is necessary. Therefore, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model with random effects for the system parameters. Further, we apply our model to data that were collected using the Oregon adolescent interaction task: 66 normal and 67 depressed adolescents engaged in a conflict-oriented interaction with their parents and second-to-second physiological and behavioral measures were obtained. System parameters in normal and depressed adolescents were compared, which led to interesting discussions in the light of findings in recent literature on the links between cardiovascular processes, emotion dynamics and depression. We illustrate that our approach is flexible and general: The model can be applied to any time series for multiple systems (where a system can represent any entity) and moreover, one is free to focus on various components of this versatile model.},

To date, functional neuroimaging studies have detailed developmental changes in systems supporting inhibitory control exerted at the single-trial level, but changes underlying the ability to maintain an inhibitory task set remain little understood. Here we present findings from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study that characterizes the development of systems supporting both transient (trial-related) and sustained (task set-related) activation during performance of the antisaccade task-an oculomotor test of inhibitory control (Hallett, 1978). Transient activation decreased from childhood to adolescence in regions known to support inhibitory processes and oculomotor control, likely reflecting less effortful response production. In contrast, sustained activation increased to adulthood in regions implicated in control. Our results suggest that development of the ability to maintain a task set is primary to the maturation of inhibitory control and, furthermore, that this ability is still immature in adolescence.},

Observing exclusion (vs. inclusion) activated regions associated with mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus), and highly empathic individuals activated both mentalizing regions and social pain-related regions (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Additionally, the empathy-related activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal cortex was associated with later prosocial behavior toward the victim, and exploratory mediation analyses indicated that medial prefrontal cortex activity, in particular, may support the link between trait empathy and prosocial behavior. Overall, findings suggest that empathy-related neural responses to social experiences may promote spontaneous prosocial treatment of those in need.},

Using a large sample of 235 male adolescents and 235 females matched for age and handedness, we investigated the sex-specific lateralization of amygdala activation during an emotional face perception {fMRI} task. Performing a formal sex by hemisphere analysis, we observed in males a significantly stronger right amygdala activation as compared to females. Our results indicate that adolescents display a sex-dependent lateralization of amygdala activation that is also present in basic processes of emotional perception.

First, we analyzed data from a longitudinal experiment measuring cued recall and stem completion from 1 min to 28 days after study, with more observations per interval per participant than in previous studies. Second, we analyzed the data using hierarchical models, avoiding distortions due to averaging over participants. Third, we implemented the models in a Bayesian framework, enabling our analysis to account for the ability of candidate forgetting functions to imitate each other. An exponential function provided the best fit to individual participant data collected under both explicit and implicit retrieval instructions, but Bayesian model selection favored a power function. All analysis supported above chance asymptotic retention, suggesting that, despite quite brief study, storage of some memories was effectively permanent.},

	abstract = {Might increased risk taking in adolescence result in part from underdeveloped conflict-monitoring circuitry in the posterior mesofrontal cortex ({PMC})? Adults and adolescents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary game of "chicken." As subjects watched ostensible winnings increase over time, they decided when to press a button to bank their winnings, knowing that if they did not stop pursuing money reward before a secret varying time limit, they would "bust" and either lose the money accrued on the current trial (low-penalty trials) or forfeit trial winnings plus a portion of previous winnings (high-penalty trials). Reward accrual at risk of low penalty (contrasted with guaranteed reward) activated the {PMC} in adults but not in adolescents. Across all subjects, this activation (1) correlated positively with age but negatively with risk exposure and (2) was greater when subjects busted on the previous low-penalty trial. Reward accrual at risk of high penalty was terminated sooner and recruited the {PMC} in both adults and adolescents when contrasted with guaranteed reward. Predecision {PMC} activation in the high-penalty trials was significantly reduced in trials when subjects busted. These data suggest that (1) under threat of an explicit severe penalty, recruitment of the {PMC} is similar in adolescents and adults and correlates with error avoidance, and (2) when potential penalties for a rewarding behavior are mild enough to encourage some risk taking, predecision {PMC} activation by a reward/risk conflict is sensitive to previous error outcomes, predictive of risk-aversive behavior in that trial, and underactive in adolescents.},

Responses of nucleus accumbens and amygdala to valenced outcomes (reward receipt and reward omission) were assayed using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure paired with a monetary reward task in 14 adults and 16 adolescents. Bilateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens showed significantly greater activation when winning than when failing to win in both groups. Group comparisons revealed stronger activation of left nucleus accumbens by adolescents, and of left amygdala by adults. When examining responses to reward receipts and to reward omissions separately, the most robust group difference was within the amygdala during reward omission. The reduction of the {fMRI} {BOLD} signal in the amygdala in response to reward omission was larger for adults than for adolescents. Correlations showed a close link between negative emotion and amygdala decreased {BOLD} signal in adults, and between positive emotion and nucleus accumbens activation in adolescents. Overall, these findings support the notion that the signal differences between positive and negative outcomes involve the nucleus accumbens more in adolescents than in adults, and the amygdala more in adults than in adolescents. These developmental differences, if replicated, may have important implications for the development of early-onset disorders of emotion and motivation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Maturation of prefrontal circuits during adolescence contributes to the development of cognitive processes such as decision-making. Recent theories suggest that these neural changes also play a role in the shift from generalized anxiety disorder ({GAD}) to depression that often occurs during this developmental period. Cognitive models of the development of {GAD} highlight the role of intolerance of uncertainty ({IU}), which can be characterized behaviorally by impairments in decision-making. The present study examines potential developmental differences in frontal regions associated with uncertain decision-making, and tests the impact of {IU} on these circuits.
{METHODS}: Twelve healthy adults (ages 19-36) and 12 healthy adolescents (ages 13-17) completed a decision-making task with conditions of varied uncertainty while {fMRI} scans were acquired. They also completed measures of worry and {IU}, and a questionnaire about their levels of anxiety and certainty during the task.
{RESULTS}: Combined group analyses demonstrated significant linear effects of uncertainty on activity within anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}). Region of interest ({ROI})-based analysis found a significant interaction of group and {IU} ratings in {ACC}. Increased {IU} was associated with robust linear increases in {ACC} activity only in adolescents. An {ROI} analysis of feedback-related processing found that adolescents demonstrated greater activation during incorrect trials relative to correct trials, while the adults showed no difference in neural activity associated with incorrect and correct feedback.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This decision-making task was shown to be effective at eliciting uncertainty-related {ACC} activity in adults and adolescents. Further, {IU} impacts {ACC} activity in adolescents during uncertain decision-making, providing preliminary support for a developmental model of {GAD}.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.03.015},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Adolescence is a transition period from childhood to adulthood that is often characterized by emotional instability. This period is also a time of increased incidence of anxiety and depression, underscoring the importance of understanding biological substrates of behavioral and emotion regulation during adolescence. Developmental changes in the brain in concert with individual predispositions for anxiety might underlie the increased risk for poor outcomes reported during adolescence. We tested the hypothesis that difficulties in regulating behavior in emotional contexts in adolescents might be due to competition between heightened activity in subcortical emotional processing systems and immature top-down prefrontal systems. Individual differences in emotional reactivity might put some teens at greater risk during this sensitive transition in development.
{METHODS}: We examined the association between emotion regulation and frontoamygdala circuitry in 60 children, adolescents, and adults with an emotional go-nogo paradigm. We went beyond examining the magnitude of neural activity and focused on neural adaptation within this circuitry across time with functional magnetic resonance imaging.
{RESULTS}: Adolescents showed exaggerated amygdala activity relative to children and adults. This age-related difference decreased with repeated exposures to the stimuli, and individual differences in self-ratings of anxiety predicted the extent of adaptation or habituation in amygdala. Individuals with higher trait anxiety showed less habituation over repeated exposures. This failure to habituate was associated with less functional connectivity between ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These findings suggest that exaggerated emotional reactivity during adolescence might increase the need for top-down control and put individuals with less control at greater risk for poor outcomes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Females appear to be more sensitive and responsive to social cues, including threat signals, than are males. Recent theoretical models suggest that developmental changes in brain functioning play important roles in the emergence of such gender differences.
{METHODS}: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine developmental and gender differences in activation of neural structures thought to mediate attention to emotional faces depicting varying degrees of threat. Analyses focused on the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex during the evaluation of threat conveyed by faces. Healthy adolescents (n = 17; 53\% male) and adults (n = 17; 53\% male) were scanned while they rated how threatening pictures of neutral and emotional (angry, fearful, or happy) faces appeared.
{RESULTS}: Results indicate significant interactions among age, gender, and face type for activation during explicit threat monitoring. In particular, adult women activated orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala selectively to unambiguous threat (angry) cues, while adult men showed a less discriminating pattern of activation. No gender differences were evident for adolescents, who as a group resembled adult males.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These findings suggest that there are gender differences in patterns of neural responses to emotional faces that are not fully apparent until adulthood.},

	abstract = {Emotions have been conceptualized as representations of bodily responses to a stimulus that critically involves the autonomic nervous system ({ANS}). An association between amygdala activation and {ANS} activity has been shown in adults. However, to date, no studies have demonstrated this association in adolescents. Examining the interaction between the {ANS} and amygdala in healthy adolescents may provide information about age-related changes in the association between amygdala activation and {ANS} measures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between amygdala activation and heart rate in normal adolescents. Eighteen 12- to 17-year old adolescents participated. Heart rate data was collected during functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects performed a facial expression matching task that reliably activates the amygdala. Adolescents showed significant amygdala activation for all facial expressions relative to the shape-matching, control task. Moreover, the degree of activation in the right amygdala for Fearful faces was significantly correlated with heart rate (Spearman's rho=0.55, p=0.018, two-tailed). This study shows that amygdala activity is related to heart rate in healthy adolescents. Thus, similar to adults, adolescents show a coupling between processing emotional events and adjusting the {ANS} accordingly. Furthermore, this study confirms previous adolescent studies showing amygdala activation to Fearful, Angry, and Happy faces. Finally, the results of the present study lay the foundation for future research to investigate whether adolescents with mood or anxiety disorders show an altered coupling between processing emotionally salient events and {ANS} activity.},

During this time, increasing cognitive control over behavior enhances the voluntary suppression of reflexive/impulsive response tendencies. Recently, with the advent of functional {MRI}, it has become possible to characterize changes in brain activity during cognitive development. In order to investigate the cognitive and brain maturation subserving the ability to voluntarily suppress context-inappropriate behavior, we tested 8-30 year olds in an oculomotor response-suppression task. Behavioral results indicated that adult-like ability to inhibit prepotent responses matured gradually through childhood and adolescence. Functional {MRI} results indicated that brain activation in frontal, parietal, striatal, and thalamic regions increased progressively from childhood to adulthood. Prefrontal cortex was more active in adolescents than in children or adults; adults demonstrated greater activation in the lateral cerebellum than younger subjects. These results suggest that efficient top-down modulation of reflexive acts may not be fully developed until adulthood and provide evidence that maturation of function across widely distributed brain regions lays the groundwork for enhanced voluntary control of behavior during cognitive development.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Functional disturbances in reward-related brain systems are thought to play a role in the development of mood, impulse, and substance-abuse disorders. Studies in nonhuman primates have identified brain regions, including the dorsal/ventral striatum and orbital-frontal cortex, in which neural activity is modulated by reward. Recent studies in adults have concurred with these findings by observing reward-contingent blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) responses in these regions during functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) paradigms; however, no previous studies indicate whether comparable modulations of neural activity exist in the brain reward systems of children and adolescents.
{METHODS}: We used event-related {fMRI} and a behavioral paradigm modeled on previous work in adults to study brain responses to monetary gains and losses in psychiatrically healthy children and adolescents as part of a program examining the neural substrates of anxiety and depression in youth.
{RESULTS}: Regions and time-courses of reward-related activity were similar to those observed in adults with condition-dependent {BOLD} changes in the ventral striatum and lateral and medial orbital-frontal cortex; specifically, these regions showed larger responses to positive than to negative feedback.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results provide further evidence for the value of event-related {fMRI} in examining reward systems of the brain, demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in children and adolescents, and establish a baseline from which to understand the pathophysiology of reward-related psychiatric disorders in youth.},

Thirty-three adolescents with no personal or family history of any psychiatric illness were administered the Wheel of Fortune ({WOF}) task using a functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol. The {WOF} is a computerized two-choice, probabilistic monetary reward task. Selection of a reward, particularly a low-probability/high-magnitude reward choice, induced greater activations in dorsal {ACC}, ventrolateral {OFC} and {mPFC} than the control condition. Although similar findings have been reported by earlier studies, the results from this study were not impacted by reaction times and expected values and persisted even after controlling for sociodemographic factors. Post hoc analysis revealed greater activation of {ACC} and {mPFC} in response to selection of rewards of larger magnitude than those of smaller magnitude when the probability of reward was maintained constant. Adolescents with greater frequency of high-risk behavior (defined as low-probability/high-magnitude reward choice) had lower activation of {ACC}, {OFC} and {mPFC} than those who engaged in this behavior less frequently. These findings suggest individual differences in prefrontal cortical function with regards to decision-making process in adolescents.},

To test the hypothesis of developmental frontalization in emotional processing, we analyzed the correlation between age and prefrontal cortex activity in a sample of 16 healthy adolescents (nine boys; seven girls), ranging in age from 8 to 15 years, as they viewed images of fearful and happy faces while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}). During fear perception, age was significantly positively correlated with greater functional activity within the prefrontal cortex, whereas no significant relationship was evident between age and activity in the amygdala. Consistent with previous gender-related findings, age was significantly correlated with bilateral prefrontal activity for the sample of females, but was only significantly related to right prefrontal activity for the males. In contrast, similar age-related correlations were not evident during the perception of happy faces. These results suggest that the maturation of threat-related emotional processing during adolescence is related to the progressive acquisition of greater functional activity within the prefrontal cortex. The hypothesis of age related decreases in amygdala activity was not supported, but may have been due to low signal-to-noise and inadequate power in the present sample to resolve subtle changes in this small structure.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}) has attracted a lot of interest due to its involvement in motor control and language processing. More recently, it has also been implicated for the processing of empathy. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate if neuroimaging studies in humans reveal distinct foci related to empathy as compared to those in motor and speech control in the {IFG}.
Materials and methods
We reviewed {MEDLINE} for functional imaging studies on healthy subjects published between 1991 and 2007. With the search terms “inferior frontal gyrus”, and “statistical parametric mapping” 485 studies were identified. We performed a non-hierarchical cluster–centre analysis of the stereotactic coordinates of the reported 1042 significant activation peaks and investigated seven functional categories using a score of specificity ({SCSP}).
Results
We found four significant, spatially distinct clusters. Three left-hemispheric clusters included one for processing of empathy, one closely adjacent for semantic and phonological processing, and one for working memory, while one cluster for fine movement control was located in the right hemisphere.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis demonstrates a spatio-functional diversity of the left human {IFG} for processing of language, working memory and empathy. Notably, phonological and semantic processing collapsed into one cluster. Fine movement control located in a cluster in the right {IFG} occurred in a virtually mirror-like location to processing of empathy in the left hemisphere. These observations are in accordance with the notion of the mirror neuron system mediating specialized links between perception and action.},

The neural basis of this protracted development is poorly understood. In this study, we used functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) to examine {VSWM} function in children, adolescents, and young adults, ages 7-22. Subjects performed a 2-back {VSWM} experiment that required dynamic storage and manipulation of spatial information. Accuracy and response latency on the {VSWM} task improved gradually, extending into young adulthood. Age-related increases in brain activation were observed in focal regions of the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (including Broca's area), left premotor cortex, and left and right posterior parietal cortex. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relative contributions of age, accuracy, and response latency on activation. Our analysis showed that age was the most significant predictor of activation in these brain regions. These findings provide strong evidence for a process of protracted functional maturation of bilateral fronto-parietal neural networks involved in {VSWM} development. At least two neural systems involved in {VSWM} mature together: (i) a right hemisphere visuo-spatial attentional system, and (ii) a left hemisphere phonological storage and rehearsal system. These observations suggest that visually and verbally mediated mnemonic processes, and their neural representations, develop concurrently during childhood and adolescence and into young adulthood.},

	abstract = {Most teenage fears subside with age, a change that may reflect brain maturation in the service of refined fear learning. Whereas adults clearly demarcate safe situations from real dangers, attenuating fear to the former but not the latter, adolescents' immaturity in prefrontal cortex function may limit their ability to form clear-cut threat categories, allowing pervasive fears to manifest. Here we developed a discrimination learning paradigm that assesses the ability to categorize threat from safety cues to test these hypotheses on age differences in neurodevelopment. In experiment 1, we first demonstrated the capacity of this paradigm to generate threat/safety discrimination learning in both adolescents and adults. Next, in experiment 2, we used this paradigm to compare the behavioral and neural correlates of threat/safety discrimination learning in adolescents and adults using functional {MRI}. This second experiment yielded three sets of findings. First, when labeling threats online, adolescents reported less discrimination between threat and safety cues than adults. Second, adolescents were more likely than adults to engage early-maturing subcortical structures during threat/safety discrimination learning. Third, adults' but not adolescents' engagement of late-maturing prefrontal cortex regions correlated positively with fear ratings during threat/safety discrimination learning. These data are consistent with the role of dorsolateral regions during category learning, particularly when differences between stimuli are subtle [Miller {EK}, Cohen {JD} (2001) Annu Rev Neurosci 24:167-202]. These findings suggest that maturational differences in subcortical and prefrontal regions between adolescent and adult brains may relate to age-related differences in threat/safety discrimination.},

To identify the neural regions mediating individual differences in helpful and harmful decisions and to assess the nature of insula activation during such decisions, in the present study we used a novel {fMRI} task featuring intentional and unintentional decisions to financially harm or help persons in need. Based on a whole-brain, unbiased approach, our findings indicate that individual differences in dorsal anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), and right temporo-parietal junction activation are associated with behavioral tendencies to financially harm or help another. Furthermore, activity in the dorsal anterior insula and {ACC} was greatest during unintended outcomes, whether these were gains or losses for a charity or for oneself, supporting models of the role of these regions in salience prediction error signaling. Together, the results suggest that individual differences in risk anticipation, as reflected in the dorsal anterior insula and dorsal {ACC}, guide social decisions to refrain from harming others.},

Although major depression is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, neural correlates of risk for major depression remain poorly understood. This study compares amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation in children and adolescents at high and low risk for major depression under varying attentional and emotional conditions.
{METHOD}: Thirty-nine juveniles, 17 offspring of parents with major depression (high-risk group) and 22 offspring of parents without histories of major depression, anxiety, or psychotic disorders (low-risk group) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. During imaging, subjects viewed faces that varied in intensity of emotional expressions across blocks of trials while attention was unconstrained (passive viewing) and constrained (rate nose width on face, rate subjective fear while viewing face).
{RESULTS}: When attention was unconstrained, high-risk subjects showed greater amygdala and nucleus accumbens activation to fearful faces and lower nucleus accumbens activation to happy faces (small volume corrected for the amygdala and nucleus accumbens). No group differences emerged in amygdala or nucleus accumbens activation during constrained attention. Exploratory analysis showed that constraining attention was associated with greater medial prefrontal cortex activation in the high-risk than in the low-risk group.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Amygdala and nucleus accumbens responses to affective stimuli may reflect vulnerability for major depression. Constraining attention may normalize emotion-related neural function possibly by engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex; face-viewing with unconstrained attention may engage aberrant processes associated with risk for major depression.},

A central hypothesis, with some empirical support, is that face-selective regions in the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}) are particularly responsive to dynamic information in faces, whereas the fusiform face area ({FFA}) computes the static or invariant properties of faces. Here we directly tested this hypothesis by measuring the magnitude of response in each region to both dynamic and static stimuli. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that the response to movies of faces was not significantly different from the response to static images of faces from these same movies in the right {FFA} and right occipital face area ({OFA}). By contrast the face-selective region in the right posterior {STS} ({pSTS}) responded nearly three times as strongly to dynamic faces as to static faces, and a face-selective region in the right anterior {STS} ({aSTS}) responded to dynamic faces only. Both of these regions also responded more strongly to moving faces than to moving bodies, indicating that they are preferentially engaged in processing dynamic information from faces, not in more general processing of any dynamic social stimuli. The response to dynamic and static faces was not significantly different in a third face-selective region in the posterior continuation of the {STS} ({pcSTS}). The strong selectivity of face-selective regions in the {pSTS} and {aSTS}, but not the {FFA}, {OFA} or {pcSTS}, for dynamic face information demonstrates a clear functional dissociation between different face-selective regions, and provides further clues into their function.},

	abstract = {Previous cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that performance monitoring functions continue to develop well into adolescence, associated with increased activation in brain regions important for cognitive control (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortex). To date, however, the development of performance monitoring has not yet been studied longitudinally, which leaves open the question whether changes can be detected within individuals over time. In the present study, human boys and girls, between ages 8 and 27 years, performed a child-friendly rule-switch task in the scanner on two occasions ∼3.5 years apart. Change versus stability was examined using two methods: (1) repeated-measures analyses and (2) test-retest reliabilities of blood oxygenation level-dependent responses. Results showed that with increasing age, participants performed better on the task. The changes in neural activation associated with the processing of performance feedback were, however, more reliably correlated with changes in performance than with age. Test-retest reliability was at least fair to good for adults and adolescents, but poor to fair for the youngest age group. Substantially more variability was observed in the pattern and magnitude of children compared with adults, which may be interpreted as proxy for developmental change. Together, the results show that (1) change within individuals is variable, and more so for children than for adolescents and adults, and (2) performance is a better predictor for change in neural activation over time. These findings set the stage for studying developmental change in the perspective of multiple predictors, rather than solely by divisions based on age groups.},

The cerebellum has been proposed to function in support of the postulated phonological loop component of verbal {WM}, and along with frontal and parietal cortices, has been shown to exhibit linear {WM} load-dependent activation in adults. It is not known if these kinds of {WM} load-dependent relationships exist for cerebro-cerebellar networks in developmental populations, and whether there are age-related changes in the nature of load-dependency between childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The present study used {fMRI} and a verbal Sternberg {WM} task with three load levels to investigate developmental changes in {WM} load-dependent cerebro-cerebellar activation in a sample of 30 children, adolescents, and young adults between the ages of 7 and 28. The neural substrates of linear load-dependency were found to change with age. Among adolescents and adults, frontal, parietal and cerebellar regions showed linear load-dependency, or increasing activation under conditions of increasing {WM} load. In contrast, children recruited only left ventral prefrontal cortex in response to increasing {WM} load. These results demonstrate that, while children, adolescents, and young adults activate similar cerebro-cerebellar verbal working memory networks, the extent to which they rely on parietal and cerebellar regions in response to increasing task difficulty changes significantly between childhood and adolescence.},

	abstract = {Temporal discounting ({TD}) matures with age, alongside other markers of increased impulse control, and coherent, self-regulated behaviour. Discounting paradigms quantify the ability to refrain from preference of immediate rewards, in favour of delayed, larger rewards. As such, they measure temporal foresight and the ability to delay gratification, functions that develop slowly into adulthood. We investigated the neural maturation that accompanies the previously observed age-related behavioural changes in discounting, from early adolescence into mid-adulthood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of a hypothetical discounting task with monetary rewards delayed in the week to year range. We show that age-related reductions in choice impulsivity were associated with changes in activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({vmPFC}), anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}), ventral striatum ({VS}), insula, inferior temporal gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex. Limbic frontostriatal activation changes were specifically associated with age-dependent reductions in impulsive choice, as part of a more extensive network of brain areas showing age-related changes in activation, including dorsolateral {PFC}, inferior parietal cortex, and subcortical areas. The maturational pattern of functional connectivity included strengthening in activation coupling between ventromedial and dorsolateral {PFC}, parietal and insular cortices during selection of delayed alternatives, and between {vmPFC} and {VS} during selection of immediate alternatives. We conclude that maturational mechanisms within limbic frontostriatal circuitry underlie the observed post-pubertal reductions in impulsive choice with increasing age, and that this effect is dependent on increased activation coherence within a network of areas associated with discounting behaviour and inter-temporal decision-making.},

In the present study we investigated whether individual differences in sensitivity to relational aggression among adolescent girls predicted recruitment of neural networks associated with executive function and cognitive control. Neural response was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during an affect recognition task that included unfamiliar peer faces. A finding of relatively fewer reports of being victimized by relational aggression was associated with increased recruitment of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices as well as anterior and posterior cingulate cortices in response to the affect recognition task, as well as with greater competence on behavioral measures of executive function. Our results suggest that girls who are able to recruit specific frontal networks to improve cognitive and executive control are less sensitive to relational aggression.},

However, little is known about how these regions integrate with age to form the distributed networks known to support cognitive control. In the present study, we used Granger causality analysis to characterize developmental changes in effective connectivity underlying inhibitory control (antisaccade task) compared with reflexive responses (prosaccade task) in human participants. By childhood, few top-down connectivities were evident with increased parietal interconnectivity. By adolescence, connections from prefrontal cortex increased and parietal interconnectivity decreased. From adolescence to adulthood, there was evidence of increased number and strength of frontal connections to cortical regions as well as subcortical regions. Together, results suggest that developmental improvements in inhibitory control may be supported by age-related enhancements in top-down effective connectivity between frontal, oculomotor, and subcortical regions.},

Activity in reward-related neural circuitry in anticipation of a large monetary reward was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, and anonymous self-report ratings of risky behavior, anticipation of risk and impulsivity were acquired in individuals between the ages of 7 and 29 years. There was a positive association between accumbens activity and the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior across development. This activity also varied as a function of individuals' ratings of anticipated positive or negative consequences of such behavior. Impulsivity ratings were not associated with accumbens activity, but rather with age. These findings suggest that during adolescence, some individuals may be especially prone to engage in risky behaviors due to developmental changes in concert with variability in a given individual's predisposition to engage in risky behavior, rather than to simple changes in impulsivity.},

Thus we measured brain activity with event-related {fMRI} in 40 right handed healthy male controls, age range 8-50 years, during implicit processing of fearful, disgusted, and a control condition of neutral facial expressions. There was a significant negative correlation between increasing age and neural response to fearful and disgusted expressions in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex ({BA} 10), and middle frontal gyri ({BA} 6). Hence, in healthy subjects, the functional anatomy of facial emotion processing is not 'hard-wired', but undergoes progressive change into adulthood. Possible explanations for the age-related changes in dorsomedial and middle frontal cortical activity may include a reduction in the attentional demands of appraising facial expressions as perceptual skill increases, or changes in processing the self-relevance of facial expressions during social and cognitive development.},

	abstract = {During development, children improve at retrieving and using rules to guide their behavior and at flexibly switching between these rules. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the changes in brain function associated with developmental changes in flexible rule use. Three age groups (8-12, 13-17, and 18-25 years) performed a task in which they were cued to respond to target stimuli on the basis of simple task rules. Bivalent target stimuli were associated with different responses, depending on the rule, whereas univalent target stimuli were associated with fixed responses. The comparison of bivalent and univalent trials enabled the identification of regions modulated by demands on rule representation. The comparison of rule-switch and rule-repetition trials enabled the identification of regions involved in rule switching. We have used this task previously in adults and have shown that ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ({VLPFC}) and the (pre)-supplementary motor area (pre-{SMA}/{SMA}) have dissociable roles in task-switching, such that {VLPFC} is associated most closely with rule representation, and pre-{SMA}/{SMA} is associated with suppression of the previous task set (Crone et al., 2006a). Based on behavioral data in children (Crone et al., 2004), we had predicted that regions associated with task-set suppression would show mature patterns of activation earlier in development than regions associated with rule representation. Indeed, we found an adult-like pattern of activation in pre-{SMA}/{SMA} by adolescence, whereas the pattern of {VLPFC} activation differed among children, adolescents, and adults. These findings suggest that two components of task-switching--rule retrieval and task-set suppression--follow distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories.},

Participants were scanned as they made decisions to contribute money to their family and themselves. Latino and White participants showed similar behavioral levels of helping but distinct patterns of neural activity within the mesolimbic reward system. Whereas Latino participants showed more reward activity when contributing to their family, White participants showed more reward activity when gaining cash for themselves. In addition, participants who felt more identified with their family and who derived greater fulfillment from helping their family two years prior to the scan showed increased reward system activation when contributing to their family. These results suggest that family assistance may be guided, in part, by the personal rewards one attains from that assistance, and that this sense of reward may be modulated by cultural influences and prior family experiences.},

Canonical eye-movement regions showed increased activity for correct versus error trials but no differences between children, adolescents and young adults, suggesting that core task processes are in place early in development. Anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) was a central focus. In rostral {ACC} all age groups showed significant deactivation during correct but not error trials, consistent with the proposal that such deactivation reflects suspension of a "default mode" necessary for effective controlled performance. In contrast, dorsal {ACC} showed increased and extended modulation for error versus correct trials in adults, which, in children and adolescents, was significantly attenuated. Further, younger age groups showed reduced activity in posterior attentional regions, relying instead on increased recruitment of regions within prefrontal cortex. This work suggests that functional changes in dorsal {ACC} associated with error regulation and error-feedback utilization, coupled with changes in the recruitment of "long-range" attentional networks, underlie age-related improvements in performance.},

	abstract = {Compared to our understanding of the functional maturation of brain networks underlying complex cognitive abilities, hardly anything is known of the neurofunctional development of simpler cognitive abilities such as visuo-spatial attention allocation. Furthermore, nothing is known on the effect of gender on the functional development of attention allocation. This study employed event related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate effects of age, sex, and sex by age interactions on the brain activation of 63 males and females, between 13 to 38years, during a visual-spatial oddball task. Behaviourally, with increasing age, speed was traded for accuracy, indicative of a less impulsive performance style in older subjects. Increasing age was associated with progressively increased activation in typical areas of selective attention of lateral fronto-striatal and temporo-parietal brain regions. Sex difference analysis showed enhanced activation in right-hemispheric inferior frontal and superior temporal regions in females, and in left-hemispheric inferior temporo-parietal regions in males. Importantly, the age by sex interaction findings showed that these sex-dimorphic patterns of brain activation may be the result of underlying sex differences in the functional maturation of these brain regions, as females had sex-specific progressive age-correlations in the same right inferior fronto-striato-temporal areas, while male-specific age-correlations were in left medial temporal and parietal areas. The findings demonstrate progressive functional maturation of fronto-striato-parieto-temporal networks of the relatively simple function of attention allocation between early adolescence and mid-adulthood. They furthermore show that sex-dimorphic patterns of enhanced reliance on right inferior frontal, striatal and superior temporal regions in females and of left temporo-parietal regions in males during attention allocation may be the result of underlying sex differences in the functional maturation of these brain regions.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imagining ({fMRI}) with adolescents and adults to examine developmental differences in activation in a paradigm that involved selective attention during the viewing of emotionally engaging face stimuli. We evaluated developmental differences in neural activation for three comparisons: (1) directing attention to subjective responses to fearful facial expressions relative to directing attention to a nonemotional aspect (nose width) of fearful faces, (2) viewing fearful relative to neutral faces while attending to a nonemotional aspect of the face, and (3) viewing fearful relative to neutral faces while attention was unconstrained (passive viewing). The comparison of activation across attention tasks revealed greater activation in the orbital frontal cortex in adults than in adolescents. Conversely, when subjects attended to a nonemotional feature, fearful relative to neutral faces influenced activation in the anterior cingulate more in adolescents than in adults. When attention was unconstrained, adolescents relative to adults showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate, bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, and right amygdala in response to the fearful relative to neutral faces. These findings suggest that adults show greater modulation of activity in relevant brain structures based on attentional demands, whereas adolescents exhibit greater modulation based on emotional content.},

	abstract = {Word retrieval ability is commonly assessed with a semantic verbal fluency task, in which subjects must produce a list of exemplars of a category (e.g., animals). The order in which exemplars are produced is not random; rather, subjects tend to produce “clusters” of semantically related items (e.g., cow, pig, sheep) and occasionally “switch” to other clusters (e.g., lion, tiger, bear). Patients with frontal lobe pathology (associated with focal lesions or Parkinson's disease) exhibit reduced output on semantic fluency tasks that has been characterized as a reduction in switching, in contrast to other impaired patient groups who produce normal switches but smaller clusters (e.g., [Troyer, A. K., Moscovitch, M., Winocur, G., Leach, L., \&amp; Freedman, M. (1998). Clustering and switching on verbal fluency tests in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 4(2), 137–143]). The ability to initiate a switch between two semantic categories may require the selection of weakly activated representations over active (but already reported) representations. Previous studies have shown that increased demands on selection among competing representations are associated with activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus ({LIFG}) and with deficits in patients with lesions including {LIFG} [Thompson-Schill, S. L., Jonides, J., Marshuetz, C., Smith, E. E., D’Esposito, M., Kan, I. P., et al. (2002). Effects of frontal lobe damage on interference effects in working memory.

Verb generation in patients with focal frontal lesions: A neuropsychological test of neuroimaging findings. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 26, 14792–14797]. In the present study, we investigated the neural correlates of switching in the verbal fluency task, and in particular, the role of the {LIFG} in switching between semantic sub-categories. We observed greater activation in the {LIFG} during switching compared to free generation (Experiment 1) and self-reported clustering (Experiment 2), which is consistent with the hypothesis that the switching mechanism is subserved by the {LIFG} due to high semantic selection demands.},

The present study used an n-back task and functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess age-related differences in the neural correlates of word and face working memory tasks. Seventy-eight individuals between the ages of 14 and 27 underwent scans while performing word and face "n-back" working memory tasks. We found very little evidence for age-related differences in accuracy and reaction time. We did find similarities and differences between adolescents and adults in the neural correlates of word and face working memory tasks, even in the absence of performance differences. More specifically, we found similar age-related differences in left superior parietal cortex for both word and face stimuli. We also found that age-related differences in a number of other regions (including left inferior frontal lobe, left supramarginal gyrus, left rolandic sulcus, right cerebellum and left fusiform gyrus) differed according to stimulus type.

The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models.

We present results from a fast event-related functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) study aimed at characterizing developmental changes in brain mechanisms supporting {VSWM} across different delay periods. Forty-three healthy subjects (17 adults, 18-30 yr; 13 adolescents, 13-17 yr; 13 children, 8-12 yr) were scanned as they performed an oculomotor delayed response ({ODR}) task with short (2.5 s) and long (10 s) delay period trials. Results showed that all age groups recruited a common network of regions to support both delay trials, including frontal, parietal, and temporal regions, indicative of a core circuitry needed to perform the task. Several age-related differences were found in the recruitment of regions, supporting short delay trials, including fronto-caudal areas, which could contribute to known differences in initial memory-guided saccade precision. To support extended delay trials, adults primarily recruited additional posterior parietal cortex ({PPC}), whereas children and adolescents recruited a considerably more extensive distributed circuitry. Our findings indicate that brain processes supporting basic aspects of working memory across cortex are established by childhood. We also find evidence for continued immaturities in systems supporting working memory precision, reflected by differences in the circuitry recruited by children and by continued refinement of fronto-insular-temporal regions recruited by adolescents. Taken together, these results suggest distinct developmental changes in the circuitry supporting visual spatial working memory.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Although some view the ownership of firearms as a deterrent to crime, the relationship between population-level firearm ownership rates and violent criminal perpetration is unclear. The purpose of this study is to test the association between state-level firearm ownership and violent crime.
Methods
State-level rates of household firearm ownership and annual rates of criminal acts from 2001, 2002, and 2004 were analyzed in 2014. Firearm ownership rates were taken from a national survey and crime data were taken from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Reports. Rates of criminal behavior were estimated as a function of household gun ownership using negative binomial regression models, controlling for several demographic factors.
Results
Higher levels of firearm ownership were associated with higher levels of firearm assault and firearm robbery. There was also a significant association between firearm ownership and firearm homicide, as well as overall homicide.
Conclusions
The findings do not support the hypothesis that higher population firearm ownership rates reduce firearm-associated criminal perpetration. On the contrary, evidence shows that states with higher levels of firearm ownership have an increased risk for violent crimes perpetrated with a firearm. Public health stakeholders should consider the outcomes associated with private firearm ownership.},

Two thousand three hundred and nineteen (56\% female) students (ages 13–18) from a region of southern Ontario, Canada, completed self-report measures of indirect victimization, physical appearance, dating frequency, recent sexual behavior (number of partners in previous month) and past sexual behavior (number of lifetime partners minus number of partners in previous month) as well as indexes of depression, aggression and attachment security, which were used to control for psychosocial maladjustment. Consistent with an evolutionary framework, physical appearance interacted significantly with gender, wherein attractive females were at greater risk for indirect victimization, whereas for males physical attractiveness was a protective factor, reducing risk of victimization. Physical appearance also interacted with grade, being inversely related to indirect victimization for younger adolescents and having a nonsignificant association with victimization for older youth. Finally, recent sexual behavior was associated with increased risk of indirect victimization for older adolescents only, which we discussed with regard to peer perceptions of promiscuity and short-term mating strategies. These findings have important implications for the development of interventions designed to reduce peer victimization, in that victims of indirect aggression may represent a rather broad, heterogeneous group, including attractive individuals with no obvious signs of maladjustment.

Whereas the correlates were found to be similar at each grade level, greater proportions of the variance in these dimensions could be predicted at younger than older ages. In Exp {II}, these dimensions were used to assign 531 Ss to 5 sociometric status groups: popular, rejected, neglected, controversial, and average. Peer perceptions of the behavioral correlates of these groups were solicited and found to reveal distinct profiles. A previously unidentified group of controversial children was perceived as disruptive and aggressive (like the rejected group), but also as social leaders (like popular Ss). It is suggested that researchers consider controversial children as a distinct group in future behavioral and epidemiological studies. (32 ref)},

High Extraversion substantially predicted elevated status for both sexes. High Neuroticism, incompatible with male gender norms, predicted lower status in men. None of the other Big Five traits predicted status. These effects were independent of attractiveness, which predicted higher status only in men. Contrary to previous claims, women's status ordering was just as stable as men's but emerged later. Discussion focuses on personological pathways to attaining status and on potential mediators.},

These results have led some critics of behavior genetics to conclude that heritability is so ubiquitous as to have few consequences for scientific understanding of development, while some behavior genetic partisans have concluded that family environment is not an important cause of developmental outcomes. Both views are incorrect. Genotype is in fact a more systematic source of variability than environment, but for reasons that are methodological rather than substantive. Development is fundamentally nonlinear, interactive, and difficult to control experimentally. Twin studies offer a useful methodological shortcut, but do not show that genes are more fundamental than environments.},

It was predicted that approach social motives and goals would be linked to outcomes characterized by the presence of positive social features, and avoidance social motives and goals would be linked to outcomes characterized by the presence of negative social features and that the link between approach motives and outcomes would be mediated by different processes than the link between avoidance motives and outcomes. These hypotheses were examined in three studies (two of them longitudinal) that measured participants' dispositional social motives, short-term social goals, and social outcomes (e.g., loneliness). Approach motives and goals were reliably associated with less loneliness and more satisfaction with social bonds, whereas avoidance motives and goals were reliably associated with more loneliness, negative social attitudes, and relationship insecurity. Results also suggested that these associations were mediated by different processes. Implications for the conceptualization of close relationships along these two dimensions are discussed.},

	abstract = {This research explored the contribution of social goal orientation, specifically, development (improving social skills and relationships), demonstration-approach (gaining positive judgments), and demonstration-avoidance (minimizing negative judgments). Children (N = 373; M age = 7.97, {SD} = .34) were followed from 2nd to 3rd grades. Validity of the social goal orientation construct was established through correlations with situation-specific goals and social adjustment. Development goals predicted adaptive responses (more effortful engagement, problem solving, advice seeking; fewer involuntary responses); demonstration goals predicted maladaptive responses (less effortful engagement, problem solving; more disengagement, retaliation). This study contributes to theoretical understanding of the process of peer aggression and interventions to promote optimal social health.},

Study 1 showed that a large number of trait names can be reduced to these broad dimensions, that communion comprises more item variance, and that agency is predicted by self-profitability and communion by other-profitability. Studies 2 and 3 showed that agency is more relevant and desired for self, and communion is more relevant and desired for others. Study 4 showed that agency is more important in a close friend than an unrelated peer, and this difference is completely mediated by the perceived outcome dependency.},

In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P {\textless} 0.05) but the other is not (P {\textgreater} 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling.},

	abstract = {Adaptive applications may benefit from having models of usersʼ personality to adapt their behavior accordingly. There is a wide variety of domains in which this can be useful, i.e., assistive technologies, e-learning, e-commerce, health care or recommender systems, among others. The most commonly used procedure to obtain the user personality consists of asking the user to fill in questionnaires. However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. On the other hand, our hypothesis is that users with similar personality are expected to show common behavioral patterns when interacting through virtual social networks, and that these patterns can be mined in order to predict the tendency of a user personality. With the goal of inferring personality from the analysis of user interactions within social networks, we have developed {TP}2010, a Facebook application. It has been used to collect information about the personality traits of more than 20,000 users, along with their interactions within Facebook. Based on all the collected data, automatic classifiers were trained by using different machine-learning techniques, with the purpose of looking for interaction patterns that provide information about the usersʼ personality traits. These classifiers are able to predict user personality starting from parameters related to user interactions, such as the number of friends or the number of wall posts. The results show that the classifiers have a high level of accuracy, making the proposed approach a reliable method for predicting the user personality},

In the context of the person-oriented approach, 1144 17-year-olds (565 girls, 579 boys) filled in the revised Little's personal project analysis, school burnout, depression, life satisfaction, and self-esteem inventories. Four goal orientations emerged from this data with cluster analysis: (1) property (40\%), (2) vocation (24\%), (3) social relationships and future education (23\%), and (4) self-focused (13\%) orientations. Boys were the majority in the property and the vocation orientations, whereas girls dominated in the social relationships and future education- and the self-orientations. Those in the self-orientation group were the most burned out, had most symptoms of depression and the lowest life satisfaction and self-esteem compared with other orientations. Orientations indicate the basic needs for competence (property and vocation orientations), relatedness (social relationships and future education orientation) and autonomy (self-focused orientation) (Deci \& Ryan, 2000). The time perspective is addressed on the basis of goal orientations reflecting the past (self-ruminating goals), the present (relationships and current education) or the future (upcoming education and wealth).},

In the present research, we report relations between self-generated, idiographic goals and the Big Five personality trait dimensions. Undergraduate participants (N = 1443) each listed 10 personal goals and completed a measure of the Big Five. Results from multiple logistic regression demonstrated that traits were associated with 52 of 96 goal categories. Two prominent themes emerged: Goals that if attained would compensate for perceived deficits associated with personality traits (e.g., be less shy and low Extraversion) and goals that complement trait characteristics (e.g., travel to Europe and high Openness to Experience). Observed relations are discussed in terms of goals to alter one’s perceived personality traits or facilitate long-term and not easily attained outcomes.},

To date, there have been limited attempts to identify different forms of social reward, and little is known about how the value of social rewards might vary between individuals. This study aimed to address both these issues by developing the Social Reward Questionnaire ({SRQ}), a measure of individual differences in the value of different social rewards. Exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) was run on an initial set of 75 items (N = 305). Based on this analysis, confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) was then conducted on a second sample (N = 505) with a refined 23-item scale. This analysis was used to test a six-factor structure, which resulted in good model fit ({CFI} = 0.96, {RSMEA} = 0.07). The factors represent six subscales of social reward defined as follows: Admiration; Negative Social Potency; Passivity; Prosocial Interactions; Sexual Reward; and Sociability. All subscales demonstrated good test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Each subscale also showed a distinct pattern of associations with external correlates measuring personality traits, attitudes, and goals, thus demonstrating construct validity. Taken together, the findings suggest that the {SRQ} is a reliable, valid measure that can be used to assess individual differences in the value experienced from different social rewards.},

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88\% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95\% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85\% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

The authors examined gender differences on each goal cluster and related the goal clusters to individual differences in the Big Five and narcissism. High extraversion and low agreeableness (e.g., narcissism) was the most common profile associated with major life goals, and neuroticism was essentially unrelated to the importance of major life goals.

The goal of the present work is to prove the method yields asymptotically valid confidence regions under minimal conditions. Essentially, all that is required is that the statistic, suitably normalized, possesses a limit distribution under the true model. Unlike the bootstrap, the convergence to the limit distribution need not be uniform in any sense. The method is readily adapted to parameters of stationary time series or, more generally, homogeneous random fields. For example, an immediate application is the construction of a confidence interval for the spectral density function of a homogeneous random field.},

Moreover, the content of the initial item pool should be overinclusive and item wording needs careful attention. Next, the item pool should be tested, along with variables that assess closely related constructs, on a heterogeneous sample representing the entire range of the target population. Finally, in selecting scale items, the goal is unidimensionality rather than internal consistency; this means that virtually all interitem correlations should be moderate in magnitude.

Individuals regulate their emotions in a wide variety of ways. Are some forms of emotion regulation healthier than others? We focus on two commonly used emotion regulation strategies: reappraisal (changing the way one thinks about a potentially emotion-eliciting event) and suppression (changing the way one responds behaviorally to an emotion-eliciting event). In the first section, we review experimental findings showing that reappraisal has a healthier profile of short-term affective, cognitive, and social consequences than suppression. In the second section, we review individual-difference findings, which show that using reappraisal to regulate emotions is associated with healthier patterns of affect, social functioning, and well-being than is using suppression. In the third section, we consider issues in the development of reappraisal and suppression and provide new evidence for a normative shift toward an increasingly healthy emotion regulation profile during adulthood (i.e., increases in the use of reappraisal and decreases in the use of suppression).},

The present study investigated whether developmental task-related personal goals could moderate the association between self-focused goals and depressive symptoms in young adulthood. A total of 1,276 Finnish twins aged 21–26 filled out a questionnaire on personal goals. The General Behavior Inventory for depressive symptoms at age 17 and 21–26 was applied. Longitudinal path analyses were carried out. Among those who had a goal related to their own family or life philosophy, self-focused goals were not associated with depressive symptoms, whereas among those who did not express these goals there was a strong association between self-focused goals and higher level of depressive symptoms. Among those who had a goal related to education, the association between self-focused goals and depressive symptoms was weaker compared to those who did not express these goals. These results suggest that goals related to one's own family, life philosophy, and education have the potential to decrease the association between self-focused goals and depressive symptoms.},

Results of factor analyses suggest a 3-factor solution, with a general fear factor ({FF}, {FR}, {FP}), a factor combining the hope components of achievement and power ({HS} and {HP}), and a third factor representing {HA}, but the 6 a priori factors also reflect a sound structural model. Reliability data show that the internal consistency and retest reliability of the {MMG} scales satisfy traditional standards. External validity of the {MMG} has been established in all 3 motive domains. Three separate studies document that (a) individuals high in resultant achievement motivation perform better and report more flow experience, (b) individuals high in resultant power motivation profit more from a leadership training program, and (c) individuals high in resultant affiliation motivation recollect more highly memorable affiliative themes.},

This interest is fueled by the practical desire to identify differences between children that have predictive utility, and by recognition that future advances in developmental theory, especially in relation to gene-environment interplay, can only be as good as the measures on which they rely. The aim of this article is to facilitate these practical and theoretical advances. First, we delineate a taxonomy of measurable individual differences in temperament and personality in childhood, and point the reader to proven and/or promising measuring instruments. Second, we describe the processes through which early temperament differences may become elaborated into adult personality structure and lifelong adaptation, and identify gaps in the empirical research that need to be filled. Third, we explore the various connections between temperament/personality traits and psychopathology, and direct attention to promising questions and strategies.},

Children's emotional reactions and prosocial behavior were observed when interacting with an adult in a quasi-experimental situation. Results showed that children from the two South-East Asian cultures, as compared to children from the two Western cultures, displayed more self-focused distress and less prosocial behavior. Across cultures, a positive relation between sympathy and prosocial behavior and a negative relation between self-focused distress and prosocial behavior were found. The strengths of these relations were moderated by culture.

Maternal responsiveness to distress also predicted children's empathy and prosocial responding. Maternal warmth, but not responsiveness to distress, was linked to better regulation of positive affect and (in boys only) to greater peer acceptance. Additionally, negative affect regulation mediated between maternal responsiveness to distress and children's empathic responding. Positive affect regulation mediated between maternal warmth and boys' peer acceptance. The findings support a differentiated approach to positive parenting.},

Data were collected via telephone interviews and questionnaires at 2 time points approximately 1 year apart. Results indicated that adolescents' expectations for risk-taking/rebelliousness and for alienation and mothers' expectations for risk-taking/rebelliousness predicted increases in corresponding adolescent-reported outcomes over the 1-year period. Results are most consistent with the possibility of perceptual biases with respect to storm and stress behaviors, but could indicate the existence of self-fulfilling prophecies, particularly for risk-taking/rebelliousness.},

Method: The Interpersonal Reactivity Index ({IRI}) was translated to Chinese, and an expert panel reviewed its content validity and cultural relevance. The translated instrument (C-{IRI}) was administered to 189 junior high school students and 391 university students. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a stable hierarchical three-factor structure that was consistent with structure of the English {IRI}, but the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy were combined to form a new factor. The subscales of the C-{IRI} demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Some evidence for the construct validity of the measure was also found. Conclusions: The C-{IRI} possessed acceptable psychometric properties in Chinese adolescent samples. The present findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy are not differentiated in Chinese adolescents.},

	abstract = {Psychophysiological research on empathy and prosociality in children has focused most often on cardiac activity, heart rate ({HR}), and {HR} deceleration in particular. We examined these processes in 7-year-old children during two empathy mood inductions. We independently assessed children's responses to others' distress in two different contexts: structured probes (simulated pain) and maternal interviews. We identified three groups of children who showed either (1) concern for others in distress (i.e., empathy and prosocial behaviors), (2) active disregard (i.e., anger/hostility and antisocial behavior), or (3) passive disregard (i.e., little or no concern). We compared groups on {HR} and {HR} deceleration. The active disregard group consistently showed the lowest {HR} both when groups were based on structured probes and on mothers' reports. Children who showed passive disregard displayed little self-distress during other's distress and different patterns of association of self-distress and {HR} than the other two groups. Active and passive disregard thus may reflect two different aspects of lack of concern for others. {HR} deceleration was seen for all three groups, suggesting it is not necessarily a cardiac index of concern for others. Interdisciplinary approaches and multiple-systems analysis are needed to better understand psychobiological substrates.},

As hypothesized, negative emotional intensity was a positive predictor of dispositional sympathy and personal distress but did not predict perspective taking. Consistent with our expectations, regulation was a positive predictor of dispositional sympathy and perspective taking and was an inverse predictor of personal distress. The relation between negative emotional intensity and dispositional personal distress was moderated by perspective taking; as perspective taking increased, the strength of the positive relation between negative emotional intensity and personal distress decreased.

We investigated longitudinal trajectories of sexual risk behaviors across these time periods and how these trajectories may be different for varying demographic groups. We developed multilevel growth models of sexual risk behavior for a predominantly African American sample (n = 847) that was followed for 8 years, from adolescence to young adulthood. We investigated differences in growth parameters by race/ethnicity and gender and their interactions. The final model included linear and quadratic terms for both adolescence and young adulthood, indicating acceleration of sexual risk behaviors during adolescence and a peak and deceleration during young adulthood. African American males exhibited the highest rate of sexual risk behavior in ninth grade, yet had the slowest rate of growth. Compared with their White peers, African American males and females exhibited less sexual risk behavior during young adulthood. Our results suggest that youths of different races/ethnicities and genders exhibit varying sexual risk behavior trajectories.},

Research has been impeded by erroneous assumptions that adolescent relationships are trivial and transitory, that they provide little information beyond measures of the influence of parent–child and peer relationships, and that their impact is primarily associated with problems of behavior and adjustment. This article proposes that distinguishing five features of romantic relationships (involvement, partner selection, relationship content, quality, and cognitive and emotional processes) is essential to describing adolescents’ relationships and their developmental significance. These distinctions also help to clarify the role of context, age–related variations, and individual differences in the impact of romantic experiences. Research is needed to illuminate questions of how and under what conditions romantic relationships affect individual development and how romantic and other close relationships jointly influence developmental trajectories during adolescence.},

Although greater propensity for discounting the value of delayed gratification has been associated with a range of problem behaviors and substance abuse, particularly in adolescents, the origins of individual differences in {DD} remain unclear. We examined genetic and environmental influences on a real-life behavioral measure of {DD} using a longitudinal twin design. Adolescent participants were asked to choose between a smaller (\$7) reward available immediately and a larger (\$10) reward to be received in 7 days. Biometrical genetic analysis using linear structural equation modeling showed significant heritability of {DD} at ages 12 and 14 (30 and 51\%, respectively) and suggested that the same genetic factors influenced the trait at both ages. {DD} was significantly associated with symptoms of conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use, and with higher novelty seeking and poor self-regulation. This study provides the first evidence for heritability of {DD} in humans and suggests that {DD} can be a promising endophenotype for genetic studies of addiction and externalizing disorders.},

	abstract = {It is now recognized that a number of cognitive, behavioral, and mental health outcomes across the lifespan can be traced to fetal development. Although the direct mediation is unknown, the substantial variance in fetal growth, most commonly indexed by birth weight, may affect lifespan brain development. We investigated effects of normal variance in birth weight on {MRI}-derived measures of brain development in 628 healthy children, adolescents, and young adults in the large-scale multicenter Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics study. This heterogeneous sample was recruited through geographically dispersed sites in the United States. The influence of birth weight on cortical thickness, surface area, and striatal and total brain volumes was investigated, controlling for variance in age, sex, household income, and genetic ancestry factors. Birth weight was found to exert robust positive effects on regional cortical surface area in multiple regions as well as total brain and caudate volumes. These effects were continuous across birth weight ranges and ages and were not confined to subsets of the sample. The findings show that (i) aspects of later child and adolescent brain development are influenced at birth and (ii) relatively small differences in birth weight across groups and conditions typically compared in neuropsychiatric research (e.g., Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, schizophrenia, and personality disorders) may influence group differences observed in brain parameters of interest at a later stage in life. These findings should serve to increase our attention to early influences.},

Sexuality and romantic interests emerge during this time, and adolescents spend more time with peers and less time with parents and family. While such changes in social behavior have been well documented in the literature, relatively few neurophysiological explanations for these behavioral changes have been presented.Method. In this article we selectively review studies documenting (a) the neuronal circuits that are dedicated to the processing of social information; (b) the changes in social behavior that take place during adolescence; (c) developmental alterations in the adolescent brain; and (d) links between the emergence of mood and anxiety disorders in adolescence and changes in brain physiology occurring at that time.Results. The convergence of evidence from this review indicates a relationship between development of brain physiology and developmental changes in social behavior. Specifically, the surge of gonadal steroids at puberty induces changes within the limbic system that alters the emotional attributions applied to social stimuli while the gradual maturation of the prefrontal cortex enables increasingly complex and controlled responses to social information.Conclusions. Observed alterations in adolescent social behavior reflect developmental changes in the brain social information processing network. We further speculate that dysregulation of the social information processing network in this critical period may contribute to the onset of mood and anxiety disorders during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Motivation for reward drives adaptive behaviors, whereas impairment of reward perception and experience (anhedonia) can contribute to psychiatric diseases, including depression and schizophrenia. We sought to test the hypothesis that the medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) controls interactions among specific subcortical regions that govern hedonic responses. By using optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging to locally manipulate but globally visualize neural activity in rats, we found that dopamine neuron stimulation drives striatal activity, whereas locally increased {mPFC} excitability reduces this striatal response and inhibits the behavioral drive for dopaminergic stimulation. This chronic {mPFC} overactivity also stably suppresses natural reward-motivated behaviors and induces specific new brainwide functional interactions, which predict the degree of anhedonia in individuals. These findings describe a mechanism by which {mPFC} modulates expression of reward-seeking behavior, by regulating the dynamical interactions between specific distant subcortical regions.
{INTRODUCTION} The drive to seek and experience reward is conserved across species and, in mammals, involves interactions between subcortical dopaminergic systems and limbic structures such as the striatum. Impairment of this process, observed across a number of psychiatric conditions, is the clinical symptom of anhedonia (loss of enjoyment). The neural mechanisms underlying anhedonia are unknown but could result from abnormal interactions between cortical and subcortical reward circuits. We sought to test the hypothesis that elevated medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) excitability (a clinical feature associated with anhedonia) exerts suppressive control over the interactions between two distant subcortical regions: the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum.
{RATIONALE} Clinical imaging studies have detected elevated activity in the {mPFC} in human patients with depression, and treatment is associated with normalization of this overactivity and improvement of anhedonic symptoms. Additionally, human studies have identified areas of the brain that respond to reward anticipation and experience, and this response can be suppressed in psychiatric disease. However, the source of this reward signal and the mechanisms underlying its modulation have not been causally demonstrated. We have integrated a diverse set of chronic and acute optogenetic tools with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to provide a bridge between the causal, cellular specificity of rodent optogenetics and the brainwide observations that characterize human neuroimaging, with the goal of locally manipulating and globally visualizing neural activity to understand the regulation of reward-seeking behavior.
{RESULTS} We demonstrate that stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons drives both striatal {fMRI} blood oxygen level–dependent ({BOLD}) activity and reward-seeking behavior, and we show that these are correlated across individuals. We additionally find that silencing of dopamine neurons suppresses activity in the striatum, as well as in other brain regions (such as the hypothalamus), and drives avoidance behavior. Having established this bidirectional control of reward-seeking behavior, we then tested for perturbation of this circuitry via elevation of {mPFC} excitability. We observed suppression of striatal responses to dopamine, as well as the behavioral drive to seek out dopamine neuron stimulation and other natural rewarding stimuli. Finally, we demonstrate that stably elevated {mPFC} excitability synchronizes corticolimbic {BOLD} and electrophysiological activity, which in turn can predict anhedonic behavior in individual animals.
{CONCLUSION} Our findings from experiments involving local cell-specific control, simultaneously with global unbiased observation of neural activity, reveal that the {mPFC} exerts top-down control over midbrain dopaminergic interactions with the striatum and that, when elevated, activity in the {mPFC} can suppress natural reward-related behavior. Furthermore, we observe that cortical-subcortical neural dynamics work in concert to regulate reward processing. All of these findings have implications for our understanding of natural reward-related physiology and behavior, as well as the pathogenesis of anhedonia.

Habituated rats were scanned in the awake state (top photographs). We establish that striatal {BOLD} activity is increased by optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons and decreased by optogenetic neural silencing. We demonstrate that focally elevated {mPFC} excitability suppresses reward-seeking behavior by exerting top-down control over striatal dopamine-induced activity and drives synchrony between specific corticolimbic circuits.
A way to modulate reward-seeking
Which brain regions are causally involved in reward-related behavior? Ferenczi et al. combined focal, cell type-specific, optogenetic manipulations with brain imaging, behavioral testing, and in vivo electrophysiology (see the Perspective by Robbins). Stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons increased activity in a brain region called the striatum and was correlated with reward-seeking across individual animals. However, elevated excitability of an area called the medial prefrontal cortex reduced both striatal responses to the stimulation of dopamine neurons and the behavioral drive to seek the stimulation of dopamine neurons. Finally, modulating the excitability of medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons drove changes in neural circuit synchrony, as well as corresponding anhedonic behavior. These observations resemble imaging and clinical phenotypes observed in human depression, addiction, and schizophrenia.

	abstract = {The identity-value model ({IVM}) posits that goal-directed behaviors that are identity-relevant are more likely to be enacted because they have greater subjective value than identity-irrelevant behaviors. The {IVM} builds upon results from social psychology that aspects of identity (e.g., core values, social identities, personal goals) hold positive value and from behavioral economics that behavior is driven by a subjective value calculation that integrates input from many sources. The {IVM} is consistent with evidence from neuroscience that value integration and self-processing occur in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We review related theories, define key constructs, explicate the model, and delineate its boundary conditions. We also present results in the research literature that can be mechanistically explained by the {IVM} and connected to one another through the construct of subjective value imparted by identity. We close by discussing questions about the model whose answers could advance the study of self-regulation.},

Both sides of the debate about the role of genes and brains in the genesis of human behavior have missed an important point: All human behavior that varies among individuals is partially heritable and correlated with measurable aspects of brains, but the very ubiquity of these findings makes them a poor basis for reformulating scientists' conceptions of human behavior. Materialism requires psychological processes to be physically instantiated, but more crucial for psychology is the occasional empirical discovery of behavioral phenomena that are specific manifestations of low-level biological variables. Heritability and psychobiological association cannot be the basis for establishing whether behavior is genetic or biological, because to do so leads only to the banal tautology that all behavior is ultimately based in the genotype and brain.},

Results showed (a) that greater maternal harshness at 54 months predicted earlier age of menarche; (b) that earlier age of menarche predicted greater sexual (but not other) risk taking; and (c) that maternal harshness exerted a significant indirect effect, via earlier menarche, on sexual risk taking (i.e., greater harshness → earlier menarche → greater sexual risk taking) but only a direct effect on other risk taking.

A widespread implicit assumption is that adult fitness (reproduction) of individuals born to parents who are not unusually closely related is more or less equal. Examination of three long–lived vertebrates, the long–finned pilot whale, the grey seal and the wandering albatross reveals significant negative relationships between parental similarity and genetic estimates of reproductive success. This effect could, in principle, be driven by a small number of low quality, inbred individuals. However, when the data are partitioned into individuals with above average and below average parental similarity, we find no evidence that the slopes differ, suggesting that the effect is more or less similar across the full range of parental similarity values. Our results thus uncover a selective pressure that favours not only inbreeding avoidance, but also the selection of maximally dissimilar mates.},

Emphasis is placed on the assessment of a child's sense of competence across different domains, instead of viewing perceived competence as a unitary construct. 3 domains of competence, each constituting a separate subscale, were identified: (a) cognitive, (b) social, and (c) physical. A fourth subscale, general self-worth, independent of any particular skill domain, was included. A new question format was devised which provides a broader range of responses and reduces the tendency to give socially desirable responses. The psychometric properties of the scale are presented for third through ninth grades. Emphasis is placed on its factorial validity. Each subscale defines a separate factor, indicating that children make clear differentiations among these domains. The factor structure is extremely stable across this grade range. The scale is viewed as an alternative to those existing self-concept measures of questionable validity and reliability.},

The original version of {SPPA} has an idiosyncratic and time-consuming item format, describing two adolescents with opposite characteristics on each item. A revised version of {SPPA} was developed using only one statement for each item. The original {SPPA} was administered to a random subsample of 880 subjects, whereas the rest of the total sample completed the revised edition. Concerning the original {SPPA}, results showed low to adequate reliability and poor replication of the factorial pattern. However, low correlations with the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability index were obtained, and the construct validity was supported. Concerning the revised edition, the a priori factorial pattern was replicated. Further, it had substantially better reliability, better convergent validity, and better factorial validity than the original version. The discriminant validity and the contamination by social desirability bias were the same for both versions. The data thus indicate that there is no need to retain the time-consuming and cumbersome item format of the original {SPPA}.},

	abstract = {Hopeful expectations for the future have been shown to play an important role in the positive development of youth, including youth contributions to society. Although theory and some research suggest that familial socialization may influence future-oriented cognitions, little work has focused on the possible interrelation of parent–child relationships and the development of hope, particularly during adolescence. Accordingly, the first goal of this study was to identify developmental profiles of youth with respect to hopeful future expectations ({HFE}) and parental trust across adolescence. Next, we explored whether these developmental trajectories were related to youth Contribution, indexed by community leadership, service, and helping attitudes and behaviors. We used growth mixture modeling to simultaneously examine trajectories of adolescents’ perceived connections with parents (indexed by parent trust) and {HFE} among 1,432 participants (59 \% female) from Waves 3 through 6 (Grades 7 through 10) of the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development. A four-profile model provided the best fit to the data, with the following profiles: Moderate {HFE}/U-shaped Trust; Moderate {HFE}/Increasing Trust; Both Decreasing; and Both High Stable profiles. We then explored whether hope-trust profiles were related to youth Contribution in Wave 7. Contrary to hypotheses, results indicated that the profile reflecting the greatest discrepancy in {HFE} and trust across early to middle adolescence (i.e., Moderate Hope/U-shaped Trust) was associated with the highest mean Contribution scores. The implications of the findings for future theory and research are discussed.},

Data were derived from 710 youth (69 \% female) who took part in Waves 6 through 8 (Grades 10 through 12) of the 4-H study of positive youth development. Longitudinal confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the invariance of the tripartite model of school engagement.

Using data from Wave 3 (approximately Grade 7) through Wave 8 (approximately Grade 12) of the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development, this study examined patterns of breadth in out-of-school time participation in activities and associated outcomes in positive youth development ({PYD}), Contribution to self and community, risk behaviors, and depressive symptoms. We assessed 927 students (on average across waves, 65.4 \% female) from a relatively racially and ethnically homogeneous sample (about 74 \% European American, across waves) with a mean age in Wave 3 of 12.98 years ({SD} = 0.52). The results indicated that high likelihood of participation in activities was consistently associated with fewer negative outcomes and higher scores on {PYD} and Contribution, as compared to low likelihood of participation in activities. Changes in the breadth of participation (in particular, moving from a high to a low likelihood of participation) were associated with increased substance use, depressive symptoms, and risk behaviors. Limitations of the current study, implications for future research, and applications to youth programs are discussed.},

Little research, however, has examined the simultaneous effects of both parents and important non-parental adults for {PYD}. We assessed the relationships among youth-reported parenting profiles and important non-parental adult relationships in predicting the Five Cs of {PYD} (competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring) in four cross-sectional waves of data from the 4-H Study of {PYD} (Grade 9: N = 975, 61.1 \% female; Grade 10: N = 1,855, 63.4 \% female; Grade 11: N = 983, 67.9 \% female; Grade 12: N = 703, 69.3 \% female). The results indicated the existence of latent profiles of youth-reported parenting styles based on maternal warmth, parental school involvement, and parental monitoring that were consistent with previously identified profiles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved) as well as reflecting several novel profiles (highly involved, integrative, school-focused, controlling). Parenting profile membership predicted mean differences in the Five Cs at each wave, and also moderated the relationships between the presence of an important non-parental adult and the Five Cs. In general, authoritative and highly involved parenting predicted higher levels of {PYD} and a higher likelihood of being connected to an important non-parental adult. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research on adult influences of youth development and for programs that involve adults in attempts to promote {PYD}.},

	abstract = {As developmental scientists cease to perceive adolescence as a period of inevitable turmoil and adopt the Positive Youth Development ({PYD}) perspective, psychometrically sound measurement tools will be needed to assess adolescents’ positive attributes. In this article we examine the longitudinal stability of the very short version of the {PYD} scale developed as part of the 4-H Study of {PYD}. Using a sample of 7,071 adolescents (60 \% female) followed between Grades 5 and 12, our results suggest general stability of {PYD} across adolescence, both in terms of mean levels and rank-order stability. We also show that both a global measure of {PYD} and the individual Five Cs of {PYD} consistently correlate with important criterion measures (i.e., contribution, depressive symptoms, and problem behaviors) in expected ways. Although our results suggest weak relationships among our three criteria, we especially note that across adolescence {PYD} becomes more strongly correlated with contribution but less strongly correlated with depressive symptoms, and that confidence becomes more strongly related to depressive symptoms. We discuss implications for use of the present {PYD} measure in youth development programs.},

	abstract = {Theory and research in adolescent development have emphasized that contributing to self, others, and community is important to the success of society and predictive of positive youth and later adult development. Despite this emphasis, there is a lack of qualitative and youth-centered research exploring whether adolescents themselves value contribution as part of their daily lives or future goals. Understandings of contribution are, thus, limited in their generalizability. To lessen this gap, we implemented qualitative analyses of open-ended responses from youth in the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development. We addressed questions about what is meaningful to youth and about their future goals through descriptive and thematic analyses of responses from 56 youth (66 \% female) who participated in the 4-H Study in each of three grades (6, 9, and 12). Findings indicated that most youth in this study valued acts and/or ideologies of contribution at some point in their adolescence, and several were committed to facets of contribution across grades. The analyses also identified other aspects of these youth experiences (e.g., athletics, family relationships, and academic competencies) that were described as meaningful across adolescence. Findings are discussed in relationship to youth programming aimed at encouraging well-being and contribution in adolescence.},

Latent profiles involving the problematic behaviors of delinquency, depressive symptoms, substance use, sexual activity, disordered eating behaviors, and bullying were then assessed for concurrent relationships with the Five Cs of {PYD}: Competence, Confidence, Character, Caring, and Connection. We found six latent profiles, based primarily on mental health, aggression, and alcohol use, with significant differences in Confidence levels among many of the profiles, as well as some differences in the four other Cs.

The impressive project covering one decade, 42 states and 7,000 participants demonstrates critical contributors to positive youth development. The two identified themes emerging from the set of papers are that contexts and the nature of assets matter for youth. Collectively, the papers explored a variety of positive youth development relevant questions and utilized combinations of annual assessments and data sources from an extraordinary data base. The core methodological and conceptual flaw across papers was the under-representation of minorities in the data set, which limited the generalizability of findings. While the major shortcoming was acknowledged at the onset and recognized as a failing in each paper, nevertheless, merely conceding the flaw was seen as insufficient given the policy, practice, and research implications. The inadequate sampling and follow-up of youth from families which continue to face persistent social inequality and having the most to gain from a positive youth development conceptual strategy and was a major shortcoming; it prevented within group analyses. The co-authors note that although research decisions made limited the generalizability of the positive youth development research strategy for non-white American youth, the intended goals for inclusiveness are evident and, accordingly, suggest a level of hopefulness.},

Latent growth curve analyses indicated that moral character was stable across waves, whereas civic character increased slightly by Wave 6. Trajectories for performance character varied; some youth alternatively displayed positive versus negative growth. Youth who reported bullying behavior reported lower initial levels of moral, performance, and civic character as compared to youth not involved in bullying. Bully–victims reported lower initial levels of moral and civic character as compared to youth not involved in bullying.

These include formulating workable values, learning self-regulation, preparation for adult work roles—and innumerable other un-tidy puzzles. Variable-based research can only scratch the surface of how youth go about these processes; nonetheless, systematic longitudinal research like this can provide valuable information about developmental pathways and directions of change. Highlights from these papers include the finding that older youth report more goals aimed at meaningful connection with others and contributing to society; yet also that moral character did not differ by age. The papers suggest that relationships adults, hope, school engagement, participation in out-of-school programs, and intentional self-regulation can serve as mediators of positive development. Yet, a striking finding was that comparatively few youth in the study manifest a pattern of change marked by the coupling of increases in positive youth development and decreases in risk/problem behavior.

A working model of situation perception implies the existence of taxonomizable dimensions of psychologically meaningful, important, and consequential situation characteristics tied to situation cues, goal affordances, and behavior. Such dimensions are developed and demonstrated in a multi-method set of 6 studies. First, the “Situational Eight {DIAMONDS}” dimensions Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, {pOsitivity}, Negativity, Deception, and Sociality (Study 1) are established from the Riverside Situational Q-Sort (Sherman, Nave, \& Funder, 2010, 2012, 2013; Wagerman \& Funder, 2009). Second, their rater agreement (Study 2) and associations with situation cues and goal/trait affordances (Studies 3 and 4) are examined. Finally, the usefulness of these dimensions is demonstrated by examining their predictive power of behavior (Study 5), particularly vis-à-vis measures of personality and situations (Study 6). Together, we provide extensive and compelling evidence that the {DIAMONDS} taxonomy is useful for organizing major dimensions of situation characteristics. We discuss the {DIAMONDS} taxonomy in the context of previous taxonomic approaches and sketch future research directions.},

	abstract = {The psychological and statistical literature contains several proposals for calculating and plotting confidence intervals ({CIs}) for within-subjects (repeated measures) {ANOVA} designs. A key distinction is between intervals supporting inference about patterns of means (and differences between pairs of means, in particular) and those supporting inferences about individual means. In this report, it is argued that {CIs} for the former are best accomplished by adapting intervals proposed by Cousineau (Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology, 1, 42–45, 2005) and Morey (Tutorials in Quantitative Methods for Psychology, 4, 61–64, 2008) so that nonoverlapping {CIs} for individual means correspond to a confidence for their difference that does not include zero. {CIs} for the latter can be accomplished by fitting a multilevel model. In situations in which both types of inference are of interest, the use of a two-tiered {CI} is recommended. Free, open-source, cross-platform software for such interval estimates and plots (and for some common alternatives) is provided in the form of R functions for one-way within-subjects and two-way mixed {ANOVA} designs. These functions provide an easy-to-use solution to the difficult problem of calculating and displaying within-subjects {CIs}.},

	abstract = {We propose that valuation is a mechanism of self-control. Valuation is the process of accumulating heterogeneous sources of subjective value for each option in a choice, then integrating them to produce a decision. We characterize self-control as a choice among mutually exclusive actions, such as between a goal and an impulse or between two competing goals, and self-control “success” is choosing an action that promotes a focal goal. Under the valuation model, self-control dilemmas are resolved by dynamically comparing the cumulative subjective value of the options. Each option can have an arbitrary number of value sources, and the value derived from these sources can shift over time depending on situational constraints. Valuation, then, directly determines behavior, and factors that increase the relative value of a goal-consistent option are hypothesized to improve self-control related to a target goal. We review the behavioral economics literature on three anomalies in valuation that are directly relevant to self- control (endowment, delay discounting, and diminishing marginal utility) and explain how the properties of the valuation system explain a number of phenomena, including the well-known ego depletion effect. We close by discussing ways to improve self-control through interventions that target its sources of value, notably including identity.},

Presenting evidence that one tri-variate mediation model yields a significant indirect effect, whereas one with some reversed arrows does not, is not proof or even evidence that one model should be preferred. In fact, the significance of the indirect or any other effect can never be used to infer whether one model should be preferred over another, if the models are in the same so-called equivalence class. The practice of running several mediation models with reversed arrows to decide which model to prefer should be abandoned. The only way to choose among equivalent models is through assumptions that are either fulfilled by design features or invoked based on theory. Similar arguments about reversing arrows in mediation models have been made before, but this current work is the first to derive this result analytically for the complete (Markovian) equivalence class of the tri-variate mediation model.},

	shorttitle = {The embodied brain},
	abstract = {In this programmatic paper we explain why a radical embodied cognitive neuroscience is needed. We argue for such a claim based on problems that have arisen in cognitive neuroscience for the project of localizing function to specific brain structures. The problems come from research concerned with functional and structural connectivity that strongly suggests that the function a brain region serves is dynamic, and changes over time. We argue that in order to determine the function of a specific brain area, neuroscientists need to zoom out and look at the larger organism-environment system. We therefore argue that instead of looking to cognitive psychology for an analysis of psychological functions, cognitive neuroscience should look to an ecological dynamical psychology. A second aim of our paper is to develop an account of embodied cognition based on the inseparability of cognitive and emotional processing in the brain. We argue that emotions are best understood in terms of action readiness (Frijda, 1986, 2007) in the context of the organism’s ongoing skillful engagement with the environment (Rietveld, 2008; Bruineberg and Rietveld, 2014; Kiverstein and Rietveld, 2015, forthcoming). States of action readiness involve the whole living body of the organism, and are elicited by possibilities for action in the environment that matter to the organism. Since emotion and cognition are inseparable processes in the brain it follows that what is true of emotion is also true of cognition. Cognitive processes are likewise processes taking place in the whole living body of an organism as it engages with relevant possibilities for action.},

The network approach, in contrast, assumes that psychopathology results from the causal interplay between psychiatric symptoms and focuses specifically on these symptoms and their complex associations. By using a sophisticated network analysis technique, this study constructed an empirically based network structure of 120 psychiatric symptoms of twelve major {DSM}-{IV} diagnoses using cross-sectional data of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions ({NESARC}, second wave; N = 34,653). The resulting network demonstrated that symptoms within the same diagnosis showed differential associations and indicated that the strategy of summing symptoms, as in current classification systems, leads to loss of information. In addition, some symptoms showed strong connections with symptoms of other diagnoses, and these specific symptom pairs, which both concerned overlapping and non-overlapping symptoms, may help to explain the comorbidity across diagnoses. Taken together, our findings indicated that psychopathology is very complex and can be more adequately captured by sophisticated network models than current classification systems. The network approach is, therefore, promising in improving our understanding of psychopathology and moving our field forward.},

	abstract = {This study examines variation in brain growth relative somatic growth in four hominoids and three platyrrhines to determine whether there is a trade-off during ontogeny. I predicted that somatic growth would be reduced during periods of extensive brain growth, and species with larger degrees of encephalization would reach a smaller body size at brain growth completion because more energy is directed towards the brain. I measured cranial capacity and skeletal size in over 500 skeletal specimens from wild populations. I calculated nonlinear growth curves and velocity curves to determine brain/body growth allometry during ontogeny. In addition, I calculated linear regressions to describe the brain/body allometry during the postnatal period prior to brain size reaching an asymptote. The results showed that somatic growth is not substantially reduced in species with extensive brain growth, and body size at brain growth completion was larger in species with greater degrees of encephalization. Furthermore, large body size at brain growth completion was not correlated with interbirth interval, but was significantly correlated with prolonged juvenile periods and late age at maturity when data were corrected for phylogeny. These results indicate that neither reduction in body growth nor reproductive rate are compensatory mechanisms for the energetic costs of brain growth. Other avenues for meeting energetic costs must be in effect. In addition, the results show that somatic growth in encephalized species is particularly slow during the juvenile period after brain growth at or near completion, suggesting that these growth patterns are explained by reasons other than energetic costs.},

In this chapter, historical perspectives on the self are first presented, including the contributions of William James and Charles Horton Cooley, over a century ago. A major focus is on developmental change in the self. Three periods of childhood (early, middle, and late) and three periods of adolescence (early, middle, and late) are delineated. Cognitive, social, and affective processes responsible for changes in the self are then identified. In addition, normative liabilities associated with movement to new stages are discussed. Issues involving more maladaptive self-processes are presented, along with clinical implications. The topic of the stability of self-evaluations is then discussed where it is argued, for example, that global self-esteem can change to the extent that its causes or antecedents change. Divisive arguments that it is either intractably stable or subject to change are dismissed as too simplistic and not supported by evidence. Finally, gender, ethnic, and cross-cultural factors impacting the self are discussed to broaden our approaches to an understanding of the origins of self-evaluation.},

Sexuality emerges as a major developmental element of puberty and the adolescent years that follow. However, connecting the sexuality that emerges with puberty and elements of adult sexuality is difficult because much adolescent sexuality research addresses the transition to partnered sexual behaviors (primarily coitus) and consequences such as unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. This review proposes a framework of an expanded understanding of puberty and adolescent sexuality from the perspective of four hallmarks of adult sexuality: sexual desire; sexual arousal; sexual behaviors; and, sexual function. This approach thus addresses important gaps in understanding of the ontogeny of sex and the continuum of sexuality development from adolescence through the adult lifespan.},

	abstract = {Working memory ({WM}) – temporary storage and manipulation of information in the mind – is a key component of cognitive maturation, and structural brain changes throughout development are associated with refinements in {WM}. Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that there is greater activation in prefrontal and parietal brain regions with increasing age, with adults showing more refined, localized patterns of activations. However, few studies have investigated the neural basis of verbal {WM} development, as the majority of reports examine visuo-spatial {WM}.

We used {fMRI} and a 1-back verbal {WM} task with six levels of difficulty to examine the neurodevelopmental changes in {WM} function in 40 participants, twenty-four children (ages 9–15 yr) and sixteen young adults (ages 20–25 yr). Children and adults both demonstrated an opposing system of cognitive processes with increasing cognitive demand, where areas related to {WM} (frontal and parietal regions) increased in activity, and areas associated with the default mode network decreased in activity. Although there were many similarities in the neural activation patterns associated with increasing verbal {WM} capacity in children and adults, significant changes in the {fMRI} responses were seen with age. Adults showed greater load-dependent changes than children in {WM} in the bilateral superior parietal gyri, inferior frontal and left middle frontal gyri and right cerebellum. Compared to children, adults also showed greater decreasing activation across {WM} load in the bilateral anterior cingulate, anterior medial prefrontal gyrus, right superior lateral temporal gyrus and left posterior cingulate. These results demonstrate that while children and adults activate similar neural networks in response to verbal {WM} tasks, the extent to which they rely on these areas in response to increasing cognitive load evolves between childhood and adulthood.},

	abstract = {For individuals with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}), salient behaviorally-relevant information often fails to capture attention, while subtle behaviorally-irrelevant details commonly induce a state of distraction. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to investigate the neurocognitive networks underlying attentional capture in sixteen high-functioning children and adolescents with {ASD} and twenty-one typically developing ({TD}) individuals. Participants completed a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm designed to investigate activation of attentional networks to behaviorally-relevant targets and contingent attention capture by task-irrelevant distractors. In individuals with {ASD}, target stimuli failed to trigger bottom-up activation of the ventral attentional network and the cerebellum. Additionally, the {ASD} group showed no differences in behavior or occipital activation associated with contingent attentional capture. Rather, results suggest that to-be-ignored distractors that shared either task-relevant or irrelevant features captured attention in {ASD}. Results indicate that individuals with {ASD} may be under-reactive to behaviorally-relevant stimuli, unable to filter irrelevant information, and that both top-down and bottom-up attention networks function atypically in {ASD}. Lastly, deficits in target-related processing were associated with autism symptomatology, providing further support for the hypothesis that non-social attentional processes and their neurofunctional underpinnings may play a significant role in the development of sociocommunicative impairments in {ASD}.},

The current research applies the biologically grounded fundamental social motives framework, which assumes that human motivational systems are functionally shaped to manage the major costs and benefits of social life, to understand individual differences in social motives. Using the Fundamental Social Motives Inventory, we explore the relations among the different fundamental social motives of Self-Protection, Disease Avoidance, Affiliation, Status, Mate Seeking, Mate Retention, and Kin Care; the relationships of the fundamental social motives to other individual difference and personality measures including the Big Five personality traits; the extent to which fundamental social motives are linked to recent life experiences; and the extent to which life history variables (e.g., age, sex, childhood environment) predict individual differences in the fundamental social motives. Results suggest that the fundamental social motives are a powerful lens through which to examine individual differences: They are grounded in theory, have explanatory value beyond that of the Big Five personality traits, and vary meaningfully with a number of life history variables. A fundamental social motives approach provides a generative framework for considering the meaning and implications of individual differences in social motivation.},

From creating a virtual reality simulation of the Milgram shock experiments to understanding the virtue of modesty in Muslim societies to defending soldiers moral responsibility for committing war crimes, these 31 chapters break much new ground and significantly advance our understanding of character. The main topics covered fall under the heading of our beliefs about character, the existence and nature of character traits, character and ethical theory, virtue epistemology, the nature of particular virtues, character development, and challenges to character and virtue from neuroscience and situationism. These papers stem from the work of the Character Project (www.thecharacterproject.com) at Wake Forest University, generously supported by the John Templeton Foundation. This collection is truly unique in featuring the work of many young, up-and-coming voices in their fields with new perspectives to offer. Together their work will significantly shape discussions of character for years to come.},

Here we report that changes in acoustic attributes that are well known to interact with human emotions in speech and music also trigger systematic emotional responses when they occur in environmental sounds, including sounds of human actions, animal calls, machinery, or natural phenomena, such as wind and rain. Three changes in acoustic attributes known to signal emotional states in speech and music were imposed upon 24 environmental sounds. Evaluations of stimuli indicated that human emotions track such changes in environmental sounds just as they do for speech and music. Such changes not only influenced evaluations of the sounds themselves, they also affected the way accompanying facial expressions were interpreted emotionally. The findings illustrate that human emotions are highly attuned to changes in the acoustic environment, and reignite a discussion of Charles Darwin’s hypothesis that speech and music originated from a common emotional signal system based on the imitation and modification of environmental sounds.},

Actual reports from these peer group members were used to assess peer group characteristics. Multilevel analyses indicated that peer groups did socialize some academic characteristics, controlling for selection factors. Students' peer group context in the fall predicted changes in their liking and enjoyment of school (intrinsic value) and their achievement over the school year. Students' peer group context was unrelated to changes in their beliefs about the importance of school (utility value) or expectancies for success over the school year.},

Genetic and environmental differences between families were found to account for the association between earlier age at first sex and increases in delinquency. After controlling for these genetic and environmental confounds using a quasi-experimental design, earlier age at first sex predicted lower levels of delinquency in early adulthood. The current study is contrasted with previous research with non-genetically informative samples, including Armour and Haynie (2007, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 36, 141–152). Results suggest a more nuanced perspective on the meaning and consequences of adolescent sexuality than is commonly put forth in the literature.},

	abstract = {We propose the Selfish Goal model, which holds that a person's behavior is driven by psychological processes called goals that guide his or her behavior, at times in contradictory directions. Goals can operate both consciously and unconsciously, and when activated they can trigger downstream effects on a person's information processing and behavioral possibilities that promote only the attainment of goal end-states (and not necessarily the overall interests of the individual). Hence, goals influence a person as if the goals themselves were selfish and interested only in their own completion. We argue that there is an evolutionary basis to believe that conscious goals evolved from unconscious and selfish forms of pursuit. This theoretical framework predicts the existence of unconscious goal processes capable of guiding behavior in the absence of conscious awareness and control (the automaticity principle), the ability of the most motivating or active goal to constrain a person's information processing and behavior toward successful completion of that goal (the reconfiguration principle), structural similarities between conscious and unconscious goal pursuit (the similarity principle), and goal influences that produce apparent inconsistencies or counterintuitive behaviors in a person's behavior extended over time (the inconsistency principle). Thus, we argue that a person's behaviors are indirectly selected at the goal level but expressed (and comprehended) at the individual level.},

We report a meta-analysis of twin correlations and reported variance components for 17,804 traits from 2,748 publications including 14,558,903 partly dependent twin pairs, virtually all published twin studies of complex traits. Estimates of heritability cluster strongly within functional domains, and across all traits the reported heritability is 49\%. For a majority (69\%) of traits, the observed twin correlations are consistent with a simple and parsimonious model where twin resemblance is solely due to additive genetic variation. The data are inconsistent with substantial influences from shared environment or non-additive genetic variation. This study provides the most comprehensive analysis of the causes of individual differences in human traits thus far and will guide future gene-mapping efforts.

	shorttitle = {Representational similarity encoding for {fMRI}},
	abstract = {Patterns of neural activity are systematically elicited as the brain experiences categorical stimuli and a major challenge is to understand what these patterns represent. Two influential approaches, hitherto treated as separate analyses, have targeted this problem by using model-representations of stimuli to interpret the corresponding neural activity patterns. Stimulus-model-based-encoding synthesizes neural activity patterns by first training weights to map between stimulus-model features and voxels. This allows novel model-stimuli to be mapped into voxel space, and hence the strength of the model to be assessed by comparing predicted against observed neural activity. Representational Similarity Analysis ({RSA}) assesses models by testing how well the grand structure of pattern-similarities measured between all pairs of model-stimuli aligns with the same structure computed from neural activity patterns. {RSA} does not require model fitting, but also does not allow synthesis of neural activity patterns, thereby limiting its applicability. We introduce a new approach, representational similarity-encoding, that builds on the strengths of {RSA} and robustly enables stimulus-model-based neural encoding without model fitting. The approach therefore sidesteps problems associated with overfitting that notoriously confront any approach requiring parameter estimation (and is consequently low cost computationally), and importantly enables encoding analyses to be incorporated within the wider Representational Similarity Analysis framework. We illustrate this new approach by using it to synthesize and decode {fMRI} patterns representing the meanings of words, and discuss its potential biological relevance to encoding in semantic memory. Our new similarity-based encoding approach unites the two previously disparate methods of encoding models and {RSA}, capturing the strengths of both, and enabling similarity-based synthesis of predicted {fMRI} patterns.},

	abstract = {What is the function of self-esteem? We classified relevant theoretical work into 3 perspectives. The cultural norm-fulfillment perspective regards self-esteem a result of adherence to cultural norms. The interpersonal-belonging perspective regards self-esteem as a sociometer of interpersonal belonging. The getting-ahead perspective regards self-esteem as a sociometer of getting ahead in the social world, while regarding low anxiety/neuroticism as a sociometer of getting along with others. The 3 perspectives make contrasting predictions on the relation between the Big Five personality traits and self-esteem across cultures. We tested these predictions in a self-report study (2,718,838 participants from 106 countries) and an informant-report study (837,655 informants from 64 countries). We obtained some evidence for cultural norm fulfillment, but the effect size was small. Hence, this perspective does not satisfactorily account for self-esteem’s function. We found a strong relation between Extraversion and higher self-esteem, but no such relation between Agreeableness and self-esteem. These 2 traits are pillars of interpersonal belonging. Hence, the results do not fit the interpersonal-belonging perspective either. However, the results closely fit the getting-ahead perspective. The relation between Extraversion and higher self-esteem is consistent with this perspective, because Extraversion is the Big Five driver for getting ahead in the social world. The relation between Agreeableness and lower neuroticism is also consistent with this perspective, because Agreeableness is the Big Five driver for getting along with others.},

	abstract = {Objective

Late-life depression ({LLD}) is a common and debilitating condition among older adults. Cognitive behavioral therapy ({CBT}) has strong empirical support for the treatment of depression in all ages, including in {LLD}. In teaching patients to identify, monitor, and challenge negative patterns in their thinking, {CBT} for {LLD} relies heavily on cognitive processes and, in particular, executive functioning, such as planning, sequencing, organizing, and selectively inhibiting information. It may be that the effectiveness of {CBT} lies in its ability to train these cognitive areas.


Methods

Participants with {LLD} completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery before enrolling in {CBT}. The current study examined the relationship between neuropsychological function prior to treatment and response to {CBT}.


Results

When using three baseline measures of executive functioning that quantify set shifting, cognitive flexibility, and response inhibition to predict treatment response, only baseline Wisconsin Card Sort Task performance was associated with a significant drop in depression symptoms after {CBT}. Specifically, worse performance on the Wisconsin Card Sort Task was associated with better treatment response.


Conclusions

These results suggest that {CBT}, which teaches cognitive techniques for improving psychiatric symptoms, may be especially beneficial in {LLD} if relative weaknesses in specific areas of executive functioning are present. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the consequences of the human foraging niche and multiple dependent offspring on the optimal growth trajectory of humans. We test the hypothesis that the human pattern of slow human growth between age at weaning and puberty helps defer the compound energetic demand on parents with multiple dependents, by using growth and demographic data from two foraging societies, the Ache of eastern Paraguay and the Dobe Ju/'hoansi of Botswana and Namibia. We run simulations of observed and potential growth trajectories among sub-adults and their consequent energetic demands on parents given profiles of fertility, mortality, consumption and production. We find that either sub-adult production or food subsidies from other people must substantially increase in order to compensate for the dramatic increase in energetic demand on parents if offspring were to grow faster at younger ages. Our conclusion is that slow human growth followed by a rapid adolescent growth spurt may have facilitated rising human fertility rates and greater investments in neural capital.},

The American parents describe adolescent sexuality as a biologically driven, individually based activity which causes disruption to the teenager as well as to the family. The Dutch parents, by contrast, emphasize the love relationships and social responsibility of teenagers which make their sexuality a `normal' phenomenon. The American parents exclude the sexuality of teenagers from conversation and the family while the Dutch parents accommodate culturally prescribed forms of teenage sexuality within the home. The article demonstrates how the two constructions of adolescent sexuality, and the conceptions of personhood and social life that engender them, constitute fundamentally different cultural logics. Without denying variations within the two countries, or overlaps between them, it suggests that different dominant understandings of sexuality and the individual have prevailed in the {USA} and the Netherlands.},

Competing theoretical perspectives have attributed this either to effects of father absence on socialization and physical maturation or to nonrandom selection of children predisposed for early sexual intercourse into father-absent households. Genetically informative analyses of the children of sister dyads (N = 1,382, aged 14–21 years) support the selection hypothesis: This association seems attributable to confounded risks, most likely genetic in origin, which correlated both with likelihood of father absence and early sexual behavior. This holds implications for environmental theories of maturation and suggests that previous research may have inadvertently overestimated the role of family structure in reproductive maturation.},

Inspired by this initial research, many social scientists proceeded to examine the associations of {OT} with trust in humans over the past decade. To conduct this work, they have (a) examined the effects of exogenous {OT} increase caused by intranasal administration on trusting behavior, (b) correlated individual difference measures of {OT} plasma levels with measures of trust, and (c) searched for genetic polymorphisms of the {OT} receptor gene that might be associated with trust. We discuss the different methods used by {OT} behavioral researchers and review evidence that links {OT} to trust in humans. Unfortunately, the simplest promising finding associating intranasal {OT} with higher trust has not replicated well. Moreover, the plasma {OT} evidence is flawed by how {OT} is measured in peripheral bodily fluids. Finally, in recent large-sample studies, researchers failed to find consistent associations of specific {OT}-related genetic polymorphisms and trust. We conclude that the cumulative evidence does not provide robust convergent evidence that human trust is reliably associated with {OT} (or caused by it). We end with constructive ideas for improving the robustness and rigor of {OT} research.},

In contrast to the Cartesian view of the mind operating distinctly from the body, an embodied cognition framework posits religion as being grounded in an integrated and dynamic sensorimotor complex (which includes the brain). We review relevant but disparate literature in cognitive and social psychology to demonstrate that embodied cognition shapes the way that people represent the divine and other spiritual beings, guides people’s moral intuitions, and facilitates bonding within religious groups. Moreover, commitments to a religious worldview are sometimes manifested in the body. We suggest several promising future directions in the study of religion from an embodied cognition perspective.},

Not surprisingly, its consequences have been the subject of much psychological enquiry, with a major interest in shedding light on how one adapts, who is most at risk, and why. Often the focus is on the bereaved individual, yet people do not typically grieve in isolation; most do so with family members who have likewise experienced the loss. Family dynamics affect personal grief and vice versa. What is more, family concerns, such as reduced finances, legal consequences, and changed family relationships, have to be dealt with. While the latter stressful aspects have been investigated, there is still a huge gap between the individual and family approaches. To move them closer together, we propose a family-level extension of our Dual Process Model, showing how the whole may actually be more—and more accurate—than the sum of the two parts.},

We examine three psychological barriers to the responsible use of credit and debt. We discuss the tendency for consumers to (a) make erroneous predictions about future spending habits, (b) rely too heavily on values presented on billing statements, and (c) categorize debt and saving into separate mental accounts. To overcome these obstacles, we urge policymakers to implement methods that facilitate better budgeting of future expenses, modify existing credit card statement disclosures, and allow consumers to easily apply government transfers (such as tax credits) to debt repayment. In doing so, we highlight minimal and inexpensive ways to remedy the debt problem.},

Key functions of intelligence analysis include accurately forecasting significant events, appropriately characterizing the uncertainties inherent in such forecasts, and effectively communicating those probabilistic forecasts to stakeholders. We review decision research on probabilistic forecasting and uncertainty communication, drawing attention to findings that could be used to reform intelligence processes and contribute to more effective intelligence oversight. We recommend that the intelligence community ({IC}) regularly and quantitatively monitor its forecasting accuracy to better understand how well it is achieving its functions. We also recommend that the {IC} use decision science to improve these functions (namely, forecasting and communication of intelligence estimates made under conditions of uncertainty). In the case of forecasting, decision research offers suggestions for improvement that involve interventions on data (e.g., transforming forecasts to debias them) and behavior (e.g., via selection, training, and effective team structuring). In the case of uncertainty communication, the literature suggests that current intelligence procedures, which emphasize the use of verbal probabilities, are ineffective. The {IC} should, therefore, leverage research that points to ways in which verbal probability use may be improved as well as exploring the use of numerical probabilities wherever feasible.},

Mounting evidence from across the behavioral sciences has found that most people regard climate change as a nonurgent and psychologically distant risk—spatially, temporally, and socially—which has led to deferred public decision making about mitigation and adaptation responses. In this article, we advance five simple but important “best practice” insights from psychological science that can help governments improve public policymaking about climate change. Particularly, instead of a future, distant, global, nonpersonal, and analytical risk that is often framed as an overt loss for society, we argue that policymakers should (a) emphasize climate change as a present, local, and personal risk; (b) facilitate more affective and experiential engagement; (c) leverage relevant social group norms; (d) frame policy solutions in terms of what can be gained from immediate action; and (e) appeal to intrinsically valued long-term environmental goals and outcomes. With practical examples we illustrate how these key psychological principles can be applied to support societal engagement and climate change policymaking.},

According to this account, spatial perception of slant, distance, and size is influenced by the perceiver’s ability to perform actions such as walking, throwing, or grasping. This claim is based on empirical findings that observers report hills as steeper, distances as farther, and objects as smaller when they are less capable of acting on the objects. Recently, Firestone (2013) challenged the claim that these reports reflect genuine differences in perception. One argument he levied against a perceptual interpretation is that people are not aware of these perceptual differences related to action, and they should be. Here, I argue that awareness is not a necessary condition for an effect to be perceptual, as evidenced by a lack of awareness in the case of a classic visual illusion. However, to make a strong claim for genuine effects in perception, the action-specific account must specify a perceptual mechanism, and it has yet to do so.},

For instance, estimates of U.S. annual losses indicate \$1 trillion paid in bribes, \$270 billion lost due to unreported income, and \$42 billion lost in retail due to shoplifting and employee theft. In this article, we draw on insights from the growing fields of moral psychology and behavioral ethics to present a three-principle framework we call {REVISE}. This framework classifies forces that affect dishonesty into three main categories and then redirects those forces to encourage moral behavior. The first principle, reminding, emphasizes the effectiveness of subtle cues that increase the salience of morality and decrease people’s ability to justify dishonesty. The second principle, visibility, aims to restrict anonymity, prompt peer monitoring, and elicit responsible norms. The third principle, self-engagement, increases people’s motivation to maintain a positive self-perception as a moral person and helps bridge the gap between moral values and actual behavior. The {REVISE} framework can guide the design of policy interventions to defeat dishonesty.},

First, we highlight how two forms of diversity—the diversity present in groups, communities, and nations, and the diversity acquired by individuals through their personal experiences (e.g., living abroad)—enable effective decision making, innovation, and economic growth by promoting deeper information processing and complex thinking. Second, we identify methods to remove barriers that limit the amount of diversity and opportunity in organizations. Third, we describe practices, including inclusive multiculturalism and perspective taking, that can help manage diversity without engendering resistance.

The primary approach to preventing adolescent risk taking has been classroom-based health education. Yet, most systematic research indicates that even the best programs are successful mainly at changing adolescents’ knowledge but not in altering their behavior. Research on adolescent brain development has revolutionized our understanding of this stage of life, but our approach to deterring adolescent risk taking remains grounded in old, antiquated, and erroneous views of the period. Classroom-based health education is an uphill battle against evolution and endocrinology, and it is not a fight we are likely to win. Instead of trying to change teenagers into something they are not, we should try to reduce the risks they are exposed to. We should spend less money and effort trying to influence how adolescents think, and focus more on limiting opportunities for their inherently immature judgment to hurt themselves or others. Although there is evidence that some programs aimed at strengthening adolescents’ self-regulation may also deter risky behavior, our public health policies should emphasize changing the context in which adolescents live, rather than solely attempting to change adolescents themselves.},

This article draws on cognitive and behavioral science to detail simple, low-cost, and effective tools caregivers can employ to prepare their children for educational success and then describes conditions that can protect and facilitate caregivers’ motivation to use those tools.

Yet policymakers have not taken full advantage of cost-effective and well-validated mindset interventions. In this article, we present two key academic mindsets. The first, a growth mindset, refers to the belief that intelligence can be developed over time. The second, a belonging mindset, refers to the belief that people like you belong in your school or in a given academic field. Extensive research shows that fostering these mindsets can improve students’ motivation; raise grades; and reduce racial, gender, and social class gaps. Of course, mindsets are not a panacea, but with proper implementation they can be an excellent point of entry. We show how policy at all levels (federal, state, and local) can leverage mindsets to lift the nation’s educational outcomes.},

Adolescents send and receive an average of over 60 text messages per day from their devices, and over 90\% of adolescents now access the Internet from a mobile device at least occasionally. Many adults are asking how this constant connectivity is influencing adolescents’ development. In this article, we examine seven commonly voiced fears about the influence of mobile technologies on adolescents’ safety (e.g., cyberbullying and online solicitation), social development (e.g., peer relationships, parent–child relationships, and identity development), cognitive performance, and sleep. Three sets of findings emerge. First, with some notable exceptions (e.g., sleep disruption and new tools for bullying), most online behaviors and threats to well-being are mirrored in the offline world, such that offline factors predict negative online experiences and effects. Second, the effects of mobile technologies are not uniform, in that benefits appear to be conferred for some adolescents (e.g., skill building among shy adolescents), whereas risk is exacerbated among others (e.g., worsening existing mental health problems). Third, experimental and quasi-experimental studies that go beyond a reliance on self-reported information are required to understand how, for whom, and under what conditions adolescents’ interactions with mobile technologies influence their still developing social relationships, brains, and bodies.},

We present a meta-analytic review of empirical studies on Chinese children’s rural-to-urban migration and on rural children left behind because of parental migration. We examine how these events relate to children’s emotional, social, and academic developmental outcomes. We include publications in English and in Chinese to uncover and quantify a part of the research literature that has been inaccessible to most Western scholars in the field of child and family studies. Overall, both migrant children and children left behind by migrant parents in China show significantly less favorable functioning across domains than other Chinese children. It appears that, similar to processes found in other parts of the world, the experience of economic and acculturation stress as well as disrupted parent–child relations constitute a risk for nonoptimal child functioning in the Chinese context. Further, we found evidence for publication bias against studies showing less favorable development for migrant children and children left behind. We discuss the results in terms of challenges to Chinese society and to future empirical research on Chinese family life.},

The scientific study of how people arrive at such understandings or explanations has unfolded in four distinguishable epochs in psychology, each characterized by a different metaphor that researchers have used to represent how people think as they attribute causality and blame to other individuals. The first epoch was guided by an “intuitive scientist” metaphor, which emphasized whether observers perceived behavior to be caused by the unique tendencies of the actor or by common reactions to the requirements of the situation. This metaphor was displaced in the second epoch by an “intuitive lawyer” depiction that focused on the need to hold people responsible for their misdeeds. The third epoch was dominated by theories of counterfactual thinking, which conveyed a “person as reconstructor” approach that emphasized the antecedents and consequences of imagining alternatives to events, especially harmful ones. With the current upsurge in moral psychology, the fourth epoch emphasizes the moral-evaluative aspect of causal judgment, reflected in a “person as moralist” metaphor. By tracing the progression from the person–environment distinction in early attribution theories to present concerns with moral judgment, our goal is to clarify how causal constructs have been used, how they relate to one another, and what unique attributional problems each addresses.},

We urge policymakers to consider cognitive aging as well, particularly normal, age-related memory decline. Psychological scientists attribute memory decline mainly to cognitive overload stemming from age-related reductions in sensory capacities, speed of cognitive processing, and the ability to filter out irrelevant information. Even in the absence of decline, however, memory is imperfect and forgetting can be especially consequential for older adults. For example, forgetting to take prescription medicines is an age-related problem largely because older adults tend to ingest many more prescription drugs. We propose that policymakers focus on increasing environmental support for memory that can reduce the burden on cognitive resources and thus improve recall. In providing environmental support, policymakers need to pay careful attention to potential age-related changes in physical and cognitive capacity, as well as behavior.},

In offering correctives to each of these points, we draw on psychological science to suggest new policies that could be enacted at both the local and national levels. Instead of policies that rely solely on individual willpower, which is susceptible to failure, we recommend those that make use of environmental changes to reduce the amount of willpower necessary to achieve healthy behavior.

The ideomotor framework of human actions assumes a common representational format for action and perception that facilitates imitation. Furthermore, the associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes that experience-based Hebbian learning forms links between sensory processing of the actions of others and motor plans. Social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are pervasive, automatic, and facilitate empathy. Neuroscience investigations have demonstrated physiological mechanisms of mirroring at single-cell and neural-system levels that support the cognitive and social psychology constructs. Why were these neural mechanisms selected, and what is their adaptive advantage? Neural mirroring solves the “problem of other minds” (how we can access and understand the minds of others) and makes intersubjectivity possible, thus facilitating social behavior.},

We therefore sought to examine the factor structure, reliability, and validity of scores for a revised version of the Self-Consciousness Scales for Children, a measure of {SC} in youth. The Revised Self-Consciousness Scale for Children (R-{SCS}-C) was examined in 2 studies using a community sample of children and adolescents. In the 1st study, 1,207 youth (685 girls) ages 7 to 18 completed the R-{SCS}-C as well as measures of imaginary audience, anxiety, depression, and positive and negative affect. Results of an exploratory factor analysis of the R-{SCS}-C conducted on a randomly selected subsample (n = 603) supported a 3-factor solution, including the subscales of Public Self-Consciousness, Private Self-Consciousness, and Social Anxiety. A subsequent confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) conducted on the remaining half of the sample (n = 604) revealed that this model fit the data well. Additionally, subsequent multigroup {CFAs} by gender and age demonstrated good model fit across both gender and younger (ages 7 to 12 years) and older (ages 13 to 18 years) cohorts. In the 2nd study, 245 youth completed the R-{SCS}-C twice, approximately 2 weeks apart. The R-{SCS}-C scores in these samples demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and test–retest reliability. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

Also examined was the mediating role of social skills in the relations between youth anxiety symptoms and positive and negative peer interactions. Youth sex and age were examined as moderators. The sample consisted of 397 children and adolescents (M = 10.11 years; 53.4\% boys; 74.8\% Hispanic Latino) referred to an anxiety disorders clinic. Anxiety symptoms, positive and negative peer interactions, and social skills were assessed using youth and parent ratings. Structural equation modeling results indicated that for youth ratings only, youth anxiety symptoms were negatively related to positive peer interactions controlling for primary social phobia and comorbid depressive disorders. For both youth and parent ratings, youth anxiety symptoms were positively related to negative peer interactions and negatively related to social skills. Also for both youth and parent ratings, social skills mediated the relations between youth anxiety symptoms and positive and negative peer interactions. For parent ratings only, the effects of youth anxiety symptoms and social skills on peer interactions were significantly moderated by youth age. Youth sex was not a significant moderator using youth and parent ratings. Findings suggest that difficulties with social skills and peer interactions are problematic features of youth referred for anxiety problems. Findings highlight the need to improve understanding of anxiety symptoms, social skills, and peer interactions in this population.},

In Study 2, 173 children in a normative sample were interviewed and their responses compared with sociometric ratings. A factor analysis of children's descriptions revealed three factors — Positive Interactions, Negative Interactions, and Extensiveness of Peer Network. Emotionally disturbed children scored less favorably than nondisturbed children on all three dimensions, and rejected children in the normative sample reported more negative interactions than did peer-accepted or neglected children. Reports of negative interactions were strongly correlated with teacher, staff, and parent reports of behavioral problems in Study 1 and moderately correlated with negative sociometric status in Study 2. Reports of positive interactions were significantly correlated with parent reports of social competence in Study 1 and with positive sociometric nominations in Study 2.},

Many people assume that sex differences in social behavior are categorical—that these differences represent fundamental distinctions between two distinct categories (taxa) of humans. Contrasted with this view is the idea that sex differences are dimensional—that differences between men and women indicate nothing more than relative positions along overlapping continuous dimensions. We used taxometric methods to examine whether a variety of well-established sex differences are indicative of taxa or dimensions. The evidence clearly supported the latter. Thus, for the psychological constructs that we examined, there is little support for believing that sex differences are anything more than individual differences that vary in magnitude from one attribute to another.},

However, the {BG} are traditionally considered to process information in parallel and segregated functional streams consisting of reward (limbic), associative (cognitive), and motor control circuits (Alexander and Crutcher 1990). Moreover, microcircuits within each region are thought to mediate different aspects of each function (Middleton and Strick 2002). Nonetheless, expressed behaviors are the result of a combination of complex information processing that involves all of frontal cortex. Indeed, appropriate responses to environmental stimuli require continual updating and learning to adjust behaviors according to new data. This requires coordination between sensory, limbic, cognitive, and motor systems. While the anatomical pathways are generally topographic from cortex through {BG} circuits, a large body of growing evidence supports a dual processing system. Thus, information is not only processed in parallel streams, but also through integrative mechanisms through which information can be transferred between functional circuits (Bar-Gad et al. 2000; Belin and Everitt 2008; Bevan, Clarke, and Bolam 1997; Draganski et al. 2008; Haber et al. 2006; Haber, Fudge, and {McFarland} 2000; Kolomiets et al. 2001; {McFarland} and Haber 2002b; Mena-Segovia et al. 2005; Percheron and Filion 1991). This chapter will first discuss the place of the reward circuit in the {BG}; second, how the sensory systems interface within this circuit; and third, the anatomical basis for integrating the reward circuit with cognition and motor control systems.},

Motivational states linked to self-protection and mating offer illustrative examples. When self-protective motives are aroused, people show enhanced attention to, and memory for, angry male strangers; they also perceive out-group members as especially dangerous. In contrast, when mating motives are aroused, men show enhanced attention to and memory for attractive members of the opposite sex; mating motives also lead men (but not women) to perceive sexual arousal in attractive members of the opposite sex. There are further functionally specific consequences for social behavior. For example, self-protective motives increase conformity among both men and women, whereas mating motives lead men (but not women) to engage in anticonformist behavior. Other motivational systems trigger different adaptive patterns of cognitive and behavioral responses. This body of research illustrates the highly specific consequences of fitness-relevant motivational states for cognition and behavior, and highlights the value of studying human motivation and cognition within an evolutionary framework.},

Correlational analyses assessed the relationships between subscales. Then, path analysis was conducted to evaluate whether sense of identity affected attitude toward classes, academic motivation, and lecture self-evaluation. Differences particularly in psychosocial identity and self-identity accounted for significant variance in the students' attitudes toward classes, academic motivation, and lecture self-evaluation.},

Confirmatory factor analysis verified the two-factor solution. Females scored higher than males on both affective and cognitive empathy. Empathy was positively correlated with intelligence (for females only), extraversion (cognitive empathy only) neuroticism (affective empathy only), agreeableness, conscientiousness (for males only), and openness. Empathy was positively related to parental supervision and socioeconomic status. Adolescents who would help victims of bullying had high empathy.},

The present multivariate twin study of three executive functions (inhibiting dominant responses, updating working memory representations, and shifting between task sets), measured as latent variables, examined why people vary in these executive control abilities and why these abilities are correlated but separable from a behavioral genetic perspective. Results indicated that executive functions are correlated because they are influenced by a highly heritable (99\%) common factor that goes beyond general intelligence or perceptual speed, and they are separable because of additional genetic influences unique to particular executive functions. This combination of general and specific genetic influences places executive functions among the most heritable psychological traits. These results highlight the potential of genetic approaches for uncovering the biological underpinnings of executive functions and suggest a need for examining multiple types of executive functions to distinguish different levels of genetic influences.},

On the basis of scientific research as well as U.S. legal rulings regarding lesbian, gay, and bisexual ({LGB}) rights, we make three claims: First, arguments based on the immutability of sexual orientation are unscientific, given what we now know from longitudinal, population-based studies of naturally occurring changes in the same-sex attractions of some individuals over time. Second, arguments based on the immutability of sexual orientation are unnecessary, in light of U.S. legal decisions in which courts have used grounds other than immutability to protect the rights of sexual minorities. Third, arguments about the immutability of sexual orientation are unjust, because they imply that same-sex attractions are inferior to other-sex attractions, and because they privilege sexual minorities who experience their sexuality as fixed over those who experience their sexuality as fluid. We conclude that the legal rights of individuals with same-sex attractions and relationships should not be framed as if they depend on a certain pattern of scientific findings regarding sexual orientation.},

These effects emerged for naturally occurring (Studies 1, 3, and 4) and experimentally induced (Study 2) distressing events. This effect was driven by the tendency for those who previously endured the distressing event to view the event as less difficult to overcome (Study 3). Moreover, we demonstrate that the effect is specific to evaluations of perceived failure: Compared with those with no experience, people who previously endured a distressing event made less favorable evaluations of an individual failing to endure the event, but made more favorable evaluations of an individual managing to endure the event (Study 4). Finally, we found that people failed to anticipate this effect of enduring distress, instead believing that individuals who have previously endured emotionally distressing events would most favorably evaluate others’ failures to endure (Study 5). Taken together, these findings present a paradox such that, in the face of struggle or defeat, the people we seek for advice or comfort may be the least likely to provide it.},

Links between millisecond-level precision of auditory processing and the consistency of sensorimotor beat synchronization implicate fine auditory neural timing as a mechanism for forming stable internal representations of, and behavioral reactions to, sound. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a systematic relationship between consistency of beat synchronization and trial-by-trial stability of subcortical speech processing in preschoolers (ages 3 and 4 years old). We conclude that beat synchronization might provide a useful window into millisecond-level neural precision for encoding sound in early childhood, when speech processing is especially important for language acquisition and development.},

Here we focused on late childhood and early adolescence to more closely examine the neural correlates of performance variability during this important transition period. Using a modified spatial 1-back task with two memory load conditions in an {fMRI} study, we examined the relationship between load-dependent neural responses and task performance in a sample of 39 youth aged 9–12 years. Our data revealed that between-subject differences in task performance was predicted by load-dependent deactivation in default network regions, including the ventral anterior cingulate cortex ({vACC}) and posterior cingulate cortex ({PCC}). Although load-dependent increases in activation in prefrontal and posterior parietal regions were only weakly correlated with performance, increased prefrontal–parietal coupling was associated with better performance. Furthermore, behavioral measures of executive function from as early as age 3 predicted current load-dependent deactivation in {vACC} and {PCC}. These findings suggest that both task positive and task negative brain activation during spatial working memory contributed to successful task performance in late childhood/early adolescence. This may serve as a good model for studying executive control deficits in developmental disorders.},

	abstract = {The cross-lagged panel model ({CLPM}) is believed by many to overcome the problems associated with the use of cross-lagged correlations as a way to study causal influences in longitudinal panel data. The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the {CLPM} fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the {CLPM} do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the {CLPM} and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the {CLPM} to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.},

We review evidence from both the psychological and neuroimaging literatures that has emerged since 2008, when this perspective was originally articulated. Although there are occasional exceptions to the general trends, studies show that, as predicted, psychological and neural manifestations of reward sensitivity increase between childhood and adolescence, peak sometime during the late teen years, and decline thereafter, whereas psychological and neural reflections of better cognitive control increase gradually and linearly throughout adolescence and into the early 20s. While some forms of real-world risky behavior peak at a later age than predicted, this likely reflects differential opportunities for risk-taking in late adolescence and young adulthood, rather than neurobiological differences that make this age group more reckless. Although it is admittedly an oversimplification, as a heuristic device, the dual systems model provides a far more accurate account of adolescent risk taking than prior models that have attributed adolescent recklessness to cognitive deficiencies.},

In order to test these propositions, the authors examined age differences in sensation seeking and impulsivity in a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample of 935 individuals between the ages of 10 and 30, using self-report and behavioral measures of each construct. Consistent with the authors' predictions, age differences in sensation seeking, which are linked to pubertal maturation, follow a curvilinear pattern, with sensation seeking increasing between 10 and 15 and declining or remaining stable thereafter. In contrast, age differences in impulsivity, which are unrelated to puberty, follow a linear pattern, with impulsivity declining steadily from age 10 on. Heightened vulnerability to risk taking in middle adolescence may be due to the combination of relatively higher inclinations to seek excitement and relatively immature capacities for self-control that are typical of this period of development.},

The Bucharest Early Intervention Project ({BEIP}) examines the outcomes for children originally placed in institutions who were assessed comprehensively and then randomized to foster care ({FCG}) or care as usual ({CAUG}) and followed longitudinally. Here we report on the brain electrical activity (electroencephalogram: {EEG}) of 12-year-old children enrolled in the {BEIP}. Previous reports suggested improvement in resting {EEG} activity for the group of children placed in the foster care intervention, particularly those placed before 24 months of age compared to children who were randomized to {CAUG} or those placed into families after this age. At 12 years, differences between those in the {FCG} and those in the {CAUG} persist in the alpha band (8–13 Hz), but not in higher frequency bands (i.e. in the beta band; 15–30 Hz), except in those children placed into the {FCG} who remained in high quality care environments over the course of the study. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining a stable high quality caregiving environment, particularly for children exposed to early psychosocial deprivation, for promoting healthy brain development.},

In this review, we focus on providing a framework for understanding how changes in facets of social development may correspond with changes in brain function. We argue that (1) distinct phases of social behavior emerge based on whether the organizing social force is the mother, peer play, peer integration, or romantic intimacy; (2) each phase is marked by a high degree of affect-driven motivation that elicits a distinct response in subcortical structures; (3) activity generated by these structures interacts with circuits in prefrontal cortex that guide executive functions, and occipital and temporal lobe circuits, which generate specific sensory and perceptual social representations. We propose that the direction, magnitude and duration of interaction among these affective, executive, and perceptual systems may relate to distinct sensitive periods across development that contribute to establishing long-term patterns of brain function and behavior.},

	abstract = {Background
Marijuana is currently the most commonly used drug on college campuses. Marijuana use among college students is increasing, and many students begin using marijuana during college. The goal of this study was to investigate predictors of lifetime marijuana use at college entry and initiation during freshman year.
Methods
We used responses from the first two semesters of a longitudinal study of 3146 students from 11 colleges in North Carolina and Virginia. Random-effects logistic regression models were constructed to identify factors that predict lifetime marijuana use at college entry and initiation during freshman year.
Results
Nearly 30\% of students reported ever having used marijuana at college entry. Among students who had never used marijuana prior to college, 8.5\% initiated use during freshman year. In multivariable logistic regression models, having at least \$100 per month in spending money; attending church rarely or never; current use of cigarettes, alcohol, and hookah tobacco; lifetime use of other illicit drugs; and a higher propensity toward sensation seeking were associated with a higher likelihood of having used marijuana at least once at college entry. Hispanic ethnicity, living on campus, and current use of cigarettes and alcohol were associated with a higher likelihood of initiating marijuana use during freshman year.
Conclusion
These results have implications for targeting substance abuse prevention programs on college campuses.},

Using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to visualize functional activation of these regions in 12 normal volunteers as they anticipated and responded for monetary incentives. Both individual and group analyses of time-series data revealed significant activation of striatal and mesial forebrain structures (including insula, caudate, putamen, and mesial prefrontal cortex) during trials involving both monetary rewards and punishments. In addition to these areas, during trials involving punishment, group analysis revealed activation foci in the anterior cingulate and thalamus. These results corroborate comparative studies which implicate striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the elaboration of incentive-driven behavior. This report also introduces a new paradigm for probing the functional integrity of this circuitry in humans.},

Internally, sociology appears to have moved away from research topics associated with fundamental social processes and toward social-problems research.

Key motivational dimensions thought to underlie human behavior (viz., approach vs. avoidance, autonomy vs. relatedness) were used to identify 4 broad domains of sexual motivations and to develop a measure of specific motives within each of these domains. Data from both college student and community samples are used to demonstrate the psychometric adequacy of these scales and to show that having sex for different reasons predicts distinctive patterns of sexual risk taking both cross-sectionally and longitudinally; that selection into specific types of sexual relationships partially mediates these effects; and that these needs may be differentially expressed, or even suppressed, depending on relationship context. Results provide strong support for the functionalist perspective on behavior and indicate that an adequate understanding of sexual risk-taking behavior must take into account the various needs and goals that such behavior can serve.},

Although these self-generated processes confer many benefits, they can come at an important cost, and this cost is greater for some individuals than for others. Here we explore the possibility that the costs and benefits of self-generated thought depend, in part, upon its phenomenological content. To test these hypotheses, we first developed a novel thought sampling paradigm in which a large sample of young adults recalled several recurring thoughts and rated each thought on multiple content variables (i.e., valence, specificity, self-relevance, etc.). Next, we examined multi-level relationships among these content variables and used a hierarchical clustering approach to partition self-generated thought into distinct dimensions. Finally, we investigated whether these content dimensions predicted individual differences in the costs and benefits of the experience, assessed with questionnaires measuring emotional health and wellbeing. Individuals who characterized their thoughts as more negative and more personally significant scored higher on constructs associated with Depression and Trait Negative Affect, whereas those who characterized their thoughts as less specific scored higher on constructs linked to Rumination. In contrast, individuals who characterized their thoughts as more positive, less personally significant, and more specific scored higher on constructs linked to improved wellbeing (Mindfulness). Collectively, these findings suggest that the content of people’s inner thoughts can (1) be productively examined, (2) be distilled into several major dimensions, and (3) account for a large portion of variability in their functional outcomes.},

Variable-oriented findings indicated that affiliative experiences were associated with fewer and more constructively resolved conflicts, whereas romantic experiences were associated with more jealousy. Person-oriented analyses identified six distinct types of romantic relationships: four characterized by congruent perceptions and two characterized by incongruent perceptions. Adolescents in the consummate group (both partners reporting high levels of affiliation and romance) had the fewest but most constructively resolved conflicts.

However, much subsequent research has uncovered fundamental limitations of the Rescorla-Wagner model. One response to these limitations has been to rethink associative learning from a normative statistical perspective: How would an ideal agent learn about associations? First, an agent should track its uncertainty using Bayesian principles. Second, an agent should learn about long-term (not just immediate) reward, using reinforcement learning principles. This article brings together these principles into a single framework and shows how they synergistically account for a number of complex learning phenomena.},

We argue that recent use of Brunswik's lens model to determine what physical qualities accurately communicate psychological traits has limited utility because it fails to consider the structured information provided by configural physical qualities that is central to Gibson's (1979) theory. We elaborate a developmental model of relationships between physical and psychological qualities that highlights research needed to identify configural physical qualities that may inform accurate perceptions. This model and tenets of the ecological theory yield several hypotheses regarding such qualities. Finally, we advocate the value of studying perceived affordances (opportunities for acting, interacting, or being acted upon) because this will focus attention on the neglected issue of contextual influences on social perception accuracy, and because affordances may be perceived more accurately than global personality traits.},

	abstract = {There is limited evidence on the effects of age and sex on intrinsic connectivity of networks underlying cognition during childhood and adolescence. Independent component analysis was conducted in 113 subjects aged 7–18; the default mode, executive control, anterior salience, basal ganglia, language and visuospatial networks were identified. The effect of age was examined with multiple regression, while sex and ‘age × sex’ interactions were assessed by dividing the sample according to age (7–12 and 13–18 years). As age increased, connectivity in the dorsal and ventral default mode network became more anterior and posterior, respectively, while in the executive control network, connectivity increased within frontoparietal regions. The basal ganglia network showed increased engagement of striatum, thalami and precuneus. The anterior salience network showed greater connectivity in frontal areas and anterior cingulate, and less connectivity of orbitofrontal, middle cingulate and temporoparietal regions. The language network presented increased connectivity of inferior frontal and decreased connectivity within the right middle frontal and left inferior parietal cortices. The visuospatial network showed greater engagement of inferior parietal and frontal cortices. No effect of sex, nor age by sex interactions was observed. These findings provide evidence of strengthening of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical networks across childhood and adolescence.},

	abstract = {Henry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 – June 23, 1988) was an American psychologist who taught for over 30 years at Harvard University. He was Director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the School of Arts and Sciences after 1930 and collaborated with Stanley Cobb, Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna. He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds. While personality theory in psychology was becoming dominated by the statistics of trait theory, Murray developed a theory of personality called personology, based on "need" and "press". Patterned after chemistry's Henderson–Hasselbalch equation for the {pH} of a solution, personology was a holistic approach that studied the person at many levels of complexity all at the same time by an interdisciplinary team of investigators. Murray was also a co-developer, with Christiana Morgan, of the Thematic Apperception Test ({TAT}), which he referred to as "the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music."},

	abstract = {Background Peer group deviance ({PGD}) is strongly associated with current and future externalizing behaviors. Debate remains about the degree to which this association arises from social selection. The first year of university constitutes a social experiment in which most individuals leave their home environment and recreate for themselves a new peer group. Methods {PGD} was measured in newly arrived university students and then 6 and 18 months later. Other personality and family traits were also assessed. Results {PGD} reported for high school friends at the start of university and university friends 6 months later were substantially correlated (+0.60). This correlation was only slightly diminished if restricted to students whose home was greater than 50 miles from the university. {PGD} was strongly predicted across three cohorts by male sex (+), extraversion (+), conscientiousness (−), a family history of alcohol use disorders (+) and depression (+), and religiosity (−).These predictors of {PGD} had a relatively stable impact over 18 months and, aside from sex, differed only modestly in males and females. Conclusions As individuals change social groups from high school to university, the level of {PGD} remains relatively stable, suggesting that individuals play a strong role in selecting peer groups with consistent characteristics. {PGD} is also predicted cross-sectionally and longitudinally by personality, family background and religiosity. Our results suggest that the association between personal and peer deviance is due at least in part to the effects of social selection.},

Findings suggest that fundamental social motives lead people to implicitly categorize social targets based on whether those targets display goal-relevant phenotypic traits. A mate-search prime caused participants to categorize opposite-sex targets (but not same-sex targets) based on their level of physical attractiveness (Experiment 1). A mate-guarding prime interacted with relationship investment, causing participants to categorize same-sex targets (but not opposite-sex targets) based on their physical attractiveness (Experiment 2). A self-protection prime interacted with chronic beliefs about danger, increasing participants' tendency to categorize targets based on their racial group membership (Black or White; Experiment 3). This work demonstrates that people categorize others based on whether they display goal-relevant characteristics reflecting high levels of perceived desirability or threat. Social categorization is guided by fundamental evolved motives designed to enhance adaptive social outcomes.},

These methods are broadly organized under the term growth curve models. The historical lines of development leading to current growth models span multiple disciplines within both the social and statistical sciences, and this in turn makes it challenging for developmental researchers to gain a broader understanding of the current state of this literature. To help address this challenge, the authors pose 12 questions that frequently arise in growth curve modeling, particularly in applications within developmental psychology. They provide concise and nontechnical responses to each question and make specific recommendations for further readings.},

	abstract = {Self-determination theory ({SDT}) maintains that an understanding of human motivation requires a consideration of innate psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We discuss the {SDT} concept of needs as it relates to previous need theories, emphasizing that needs specify the necessary conditions for psychological growth, integrity, and well-being. This concept of needs leads to the hypotheses that different regulatory processes underlying goal pursuits are differentially associated with effective functioning and well-being and also that different goal contents have different relations to the quality of behavior and mental health, specifically because different regulatory processes and different goal contents are associated with differing degrees of need satisfaction. Social contexts and individual differences that support satisfaction of the basic needs facilitate natural growth processes including intrinsically motivated behavior and integration of extrinsic motivations, whereas those that forestall autonomy, competence, or relatedness are associated with poorer motivation, performance, and well-being. We also discuss the relation of the psychological needs to cultural values, evolutionary processes, and other contemporary motivation theories.},

Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.},

Interpretation biases are already evident during adolescence and due to the greater plasticity of the developing brain it may be easier to change biases during this time. We investigated in healthy adolescents and adults whether stabilizing memories of positive or negative scenes modulates the later interpretation of similar scenes. In the evening, participants learnt associations between ambiguous pictures and words that disambiguate the valence of the pictures in a positive or negative direction. Half of the words were acoustically presented (i.e. cued) during post-learning sleep which is known to benefit memory consolidation by inducing reactivation of learned information. Cued compared to un-cued stimuli were remembered better the next morning. Importantly, cueing positively disambiguated pictures resulted in more positive interpretations whereas cueing negatively disambiguated pictures led to less positive interpretations of new ambiguous pictures with similar contents the next morning. These effects were not modulated by participants’ age indicating that memory cueing was as efficient in adolescents as in adults. Our findings suggest that memory cueing during sleep can modify interpretation biases by benefitting memory stabilization and generalization. Implications for clinical settings are discussed.},

Previous work has suggested both propensities for over-control and under-control of fearfulness as risk factors for anxiety problems, each of which may be relevant to observations of dysregulated fear. Given difficulty disentangling over-control and under-control through traditional behavioral measures, we used delta–beta coupling to begin to understand the degree to which dysregulated fear may reflect propensities for over- or under-control. We found that toddlers who showed high levels of dysregulated fear evidenced greater delta–beta coupling at frontal and central electrode sites as preschoolers relative to children who were low in dysregulated fear. Importantly, these differences were not observed when comparisons were made based on fear levels in high threat contexts. Results suggest dysregulated fear may involve tendencies toward over-control at the neural level.},

The results of Experiments 1 and 2 provide clear support for this prediction in contradistinction to predictions from probability matching, exemplar retrieval, or simple prototype learning models. Experiment 3 contrasted the adaptive network model with one predicting pattern-probability matching when patients always had four symptoms (chosen from four opponent pairs) rather than the presence or absence of each of four symptoms, as in Experiment 1.

	abstract = {Psychological theory has traditionally attempted to explain events in terms of motivation, emotion, or cognition. Over the past decade, psychology has come to be viewed as a paradigmatic science; the new paradigm being the understanding of behavior in terms of cognitive representations. This cognitive revolution has fostered a view of the passing of information back and forth between perceptual, memory, and motor components of an integrated system, known as the ?computational metaphor.? With cognition as the new paradigm, can we expect that the explanatory scope of psychology will be clarified? Will a cognitive perspective be extended to phenomena that have traditionally fallen under the rubric of motivation and emotion?The psychologists involved in this volume of the Nebraska Symposium address these questions specifically. Their contributions stimulate a hypothesis that the cognitive paradigm has begun to move psychology toward a ?unified field theory? of behavior and experience.Herbert A. Simon tests the limits of a pure information processing paradigm. A basic tenet of this theoretical approach is that information exists independent of the medium by which it is represented. By analyzing the information processing capabilities of nonbiological systems, or ?artificial intelligence,? we may determine which aspects of motivation and emotion require the biological substrate of cognition.Muriel D. Lezak raises a similar question by focusing on the biological substrate itself and by analyzing the constraints and determinations that it imposes. Howard Gardner considers the medium and the information it processes; thus he lays a conceptual foundation for making the facts of biological brain science congruent with the richness of human behavior and experience.},

The majority of studies on risk taking, however, focus on clinical populations and dangerous or harmful risk taking. Individual differences in learning during risk taking are rarely examined in relation to task performance. The present study examined risk taking and associated outcomes in an exploration-based instrumental learning task (Balloon Emotional Learning Task; {BELT}), which presented a series of balloons in which participants pump up for points. Consistent with prior work, sensation seeking predicted increased risk taking behavior. Importantly, however, a significant interaction between sensation seeking and associative sensitivity, an attentional construct defined as the frequency and remoteness of automatic cognitive activity, was found. Specifically, among individuals high in sensation seeking, associative sensitivity predicted fewer balloon explosions and an increase in points earned on the balloon condition with the most potential for feedback driven learning. Thus, these findings suggest that sensation seekers are a heterogeneous group, and secondary traits such as associative sensitivity moderate risk taking and learning according to context.},

	abstract = {Background
Elevated negative affect is a highly salient risk factor for later internalizing disorders. Very little is known about the early neurobiological correlates of negative affect and whether they associate with developmental changes in negative emotion. Such information may prove critical for identifying children deviating from normative developmental trajectories of negative affect and at increased risk for later internalizing disorders. The current study examined the relationship between amygdala activity and negative affect measured concurrently and approximately 12 months later in preschool-age children.
Method
Amygdala activity was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 31 medication-naive preschool age children. Negative affect was measured using parent report both at the time of scan and 12 months later.
Results
Negative affect at baseline was positively correlated with right amygdala activity to sad faces, right amygdala activity to happy faces, and left amygdala activity to happy faces. Right amygdala activity to sad faces also positively predicted parent-reported negative affect 12 months later even when negative affect reported at baseline was controlled.
Conclusions
The current findings provide preliminary evidence for amygdala activity as a potential biomarker of persistent negative affect during early childhood and suggest future work examining the origins and long-term implications of this relationship is necessary.},

The extent to which life tasks nominated by 81 college students (45 females) were appraised as shared with others and pursued collaboratively was examined through a questionnaire. Participants listed five life tasks, indicated if each life task was theirs alone, indirectly shared (others were impacted by their life task pursuit), or directly shared (another person might also nominate the life task as theirs) with others in their lives, described three activities used to pursue their life task, and coded how others were involved in these activities. Results indicated that the majority of college students’ life tasks were appraised as involving others, that directly shared appraisals were found more frequently in the relationship domain, and that directly shared appraisals were associated with collaborative life task pursuit strategies. In addition, appraising life tasks as directly shared did not appear to reflect aspects of anxiety or compensation. A content analysis of the strategies coded as involving other individuals revealed diverse ways in which others are involved in life task pursuit ranging from active engagement of others to cognitive strategies where others are implied. The findings have implications for research on life tasks and other goal structures in that structures may involve the social context in adaptive ways.},

	abstract = {In this article, I propose a sex-positive framework for research on adolescent sexuality in which I consider consensual sexual activities in adolescence as developmentally normative and potentially healthy. The sex-positive framework is contrasted with the predominant “risk” perspective that presumes that abstinence from sexual activity is the ideal behavioral outcome for teenagers. Evidence from longitudinal and behavioral genetic studies indicates that engaging in sexual intercourse in adolescence does not typically cause worse psychological functioning. The relationship context of sexual experience may be a critical moderator of its psychological impact. Moreover, cross-cultural data on adolescents’ contraception usage, unintended pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections suggest that, despite the unacceptably high rate of negative health consequences among U.S. teenagers, adolescents can have the developmental capacity to regulate the health risks inherent in sexual activity. Understanding adolescent sexuality can be fostered by considering sexual well-being, a multidimensional construct that incorporates an adolescent’s sexual self-efficacy, sexual self-esteem, feelings of sexual pleasure and satisfaction, and freedom from pain and negative affect regarding sexuality. New research is necessary to understand the development of adolescent sexual well-being, including its normative age trends, its reciprocal links with sexual behavior, and its impact on psychological and physical health.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Few longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between illicit drug use and academic outcomes among college students. This study characterized drug use patterns of a cohort of young adults who were originally enrolled as first-time, first-year college students in a longitudinal study. It evaluated the association between these drug use patterns and continuous enrollment during college, holding constant demographic characteristics, high school grade point average, fraternity/sorority involvement, personality/temperament characteristics, nicotine dependence, and alcohol use disorder.
{METHOD}: Participants (n = 1,133; 47\% male) were purposively selected from one university and interviewed annually for 4 years, beginning with their first year of college, regardless of continued college attendance. Enrollment data were culled from administrative records. Group-based trajectory analyses characterized 4-year longitudinal drug use patterns. Two grouping variables were derived based on (a) marijuana use frequency and (b) number of illicit drugs used other than marijuana. Seventy-one percent of the sample was continuously enrolled in the home institution during the first 4 years of study.
{RESULTS}: Multivariable logistic regression models demonstrated that infrequent, increasing, and chronic/heavy marijuana use patterns were significantly associated with discontinuous enrollment (adjusted odds ratio = 1.66, 1.74, and 1.99, respectively), compared with minimal use, holding constant covariates. In separate models, drug use other than marijuana also was significantly associated with discontinuous enrollment.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Marijuana use and other illicit drug use are both associated with a decreased likelihood of continuous enrollment in college, independent of several other possible risk factors. These findings highlight the need for early intervention with illicit drug users to mitigate possible negative academic consequences.},

The observed patterns of relations among the measures cast doubt on the notion that autonomy is a unidimensional trait manifested similarly across a variety of situations. For most boys and girls, the transition from childhood into adolescence is marked more by a trading of dependency on parents for dependency on peers, rather than straightforward and unidimensional growth in autonomy. Moreover, contrary to long-standing notions about the greater salience of autonomy to adolescent males than to females, girls score higher than boys on all 3 measures of autonomy at all age levels.},

	abstract = {Objective
This study examined the effects of leaving home and going to college on changes in the frequency of alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and marijuana use shortly after leaving high school. We also examined how protective factors in late adolescence predict post-high school substance use and moderate the effects of leaving home and going to college.

Method
Data came from subjects (N = 319; 53\% male) interviewed at the end of 12th grade and again approximately 6 months later, as part of the Raising Healthy Children project.

Results
Leaving home and going to college were significantly related to increases in the frequency of alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking from high school to emerging adulthood but not to changes in marijuana use. Having fewer friends who used each substance protected against increases in the frequency of alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and marijuana use. Higher religiosity protected against increases in alcohol-and marijuana-use frequency. Higher parental monitoring protected against increases in heavy episodic drinking and moderated the effect of going to college on marijuana use. Lower sensation seeking lessened the effect of going to college on increases in alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking.

Conclusions
To prevent increases in substance use in emerging adulthood, interventions should concentrate on strengthening prosocial involvement and parental monitoring during high school. In addition, youths with high sensation seeking might be targeted for added intervention.},

Prior research has demonstrated a link between testosterone and alcohol consumption, and between testosterone and neural responses to rewards. Yet, no study to date tested how testosterone levels and neural responses to rewards relate to and predict individual differences in alcohol use. The current study aimed to investigate this by assessing alcohol use, testosterone levels and neural responses to rewards in adolescents (12–17 years old) and young adults (18–26 years old). Participants were measured twice with a two-year interval between testing sessions. Cross-sectional analysis showed that at the second time point higher neural activity to rewards, but not testosterone levels, explained significant variance above age in reported alcohol use. Predictive analyses showed that, higher testosterone level at the first time point, but not neural activity to rewards at the first time point, was predictive of more alcohol use at the second time point. These results suggest that neural responses to rewards are correlated with current alcohol consumption, and that testosterone level is predictive of future alcohol consumption. These results are interpreted in the context of trajectory models of adolescent development.},

A developmental clock, along with permissive signals that provide information on somatic growth, energy balance and season, time the awakening of gonadotropin releasing hormone ({GnRH}) neurons at the onset of puberty. High-frequency {GnRH} release results from disinhibition and activation of {GnRH} neurons at puberty onset, leading to gametogenesis and an increase in gonadal steroid hormone secretion. Steroid hormones, in turn, both remodel and activate neural circuits during adolescent brain development, leading to the development of sexual salience of sensory stimuli, sexual motivation, and expression of copulatory behaviors in specific social contexts. These influences of hormones on reproductive behavior depend in part on changes in the adolescent brain that occur independently of gonadal maturation. Reproductive maturity is therefore the product of developmentally timed, brain-driven and recurrent interactions between steroid hormones and the adolescent nervous system.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that personality characteristics, such as sensation seeking ({SS}), are strong predictors of risk-taking behavior during adolescence. However, the relationship between levels of {SS} and brain response has not been studied during this time period. Given the prevalence of risky behavior during adolescence, it is important to understand neurobiological differences in reward sensitivity between youth with high and low {SS} personalities. To this end, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to examine differences in brain activity in an adolescent sample that included 27 high ({HSS}) and 27 low sensation seekers ({LSS}), defined by the Impulsive Sensation Seeking scale of the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (Zuckerman et al., 1993). In the scanner, participants played a modified Wheel of Fortune decision-making task (Cservenka and Nagel, 2012) that resulted in trials with monetary Wins or No Wins. We compared age- and sex-matched adolescent {HSS} and {LSS} (mean age = 13.94 ± 1.05) on brain activity by contrasting Win vs. No Win trials. Our findings indicate that {HSS} show greater bilateral insular and prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) brain response on Win vs. No Win compared to {LSS}. Analysis of simple effects showed that while {LSS} showed comparable brain activity in these areas during Wins and No Wins, {HSS} showed significant differences in brain response to winning (activation) vs. not winning (deactivation), with between-group comparison suggesting significant differences in brain response, largely to reward absence. Group differences in insular activation between reward receipt and absence may suggest weak autonomic arousal to negative outcomes in {HSS} compared with {LSS}. Additionally, since the {PFC} is important for goal-directed behavior and attention, the current results may reflect that {HSS} allocate fewer attentional resources to negative outcomes than {LSS}. This insensitivity to reward absence in {HSS} may lead to a greater likelihood of maladaptive choices when negative consequences are not considered, and may be an early neural marker of decreased loss sensitivity that has been seen in addiction. This neurobiological information may ultimately be helpful in establishing prevention strategies aimed at reducing youth risk-taking and suggests value in further examination of neural associations with personality characteristics during adolescence.},

Alcohol use is often part of this process, and many first-year college students develop a pattern of heavy drinking that puts them at risk for adverse consequences during their college years and into young adulthood. To better understand the development of risky alcohol use during this transition, we reviewed the literature on influences on college drinking and identified moderators and mediators that were particularly relevant for first-year alcohol use. As the transition from high school to college presents a unique opportunity for intervention, we discuss how these moderators and mediators can inform alcohol abuse prevention programs. We also identify approaches aimed at changing the culture of alcohol use on campus. Limitations of the reviewed research are highlighted in the context of promising directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Noting that adolescents' academic achievement depends, to a large degree, on adolescents' motivation, this chapter takes an achievement goal theory perspective to show how the manner in which adolescents adopt differing achievement goal orientations provides a framework for understanding the processes that contribute to their adoption of adaptive motivational orientations. This chapter begins with a summary of developments in the study of motivation over the past 20 years, focusing on the emergence of achievement goal theory and tracing the relationship between goal orientations and processes such as the use of effective and ineffective learning strategies, adoption of positive and negative attitudes toward school and learning, and engagement in cooperative and disruptive behavior. In particular, the chapter shows how adoption of mastery or performance goals may be viewed as aspects of the process of self-reconstruction in which adolescents engage, serving the development of their personal interests, establishing the basis of their self-worth, and forming desirable social relationships. Next, the chapter presents a model that situates students' motivational orientations in the sociocultural context of their schools, and discusses its implications to theory, research, and educational practices. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of the model for understanding motivation in adolescence. (Contains 168 references.) ({KB})},

	abstract = {This review examines the evidence for longitudinal predictors of substance use and abuse in emerging adulthood. Nationally representative data from the 2007 National Survey on Drug use and Health suggest that many substance use problems reach their peak prevalence during emerging adulthood (usually defined as the period from age 18 to age 26). This stage of development is characterized by rapid transitions into new social contexts that involve greater freedom and less social control than experienced during adolescence. Concurrent with this newfound independence is an increase in rates of substance use and abuse. Understanding the risk and protective factors associated with emerging adult substance use problems is an important step in developing interventions targeting those problems. While multiple reviews have examined risk and protective factors for substance use during adolescence, and many of these earlier predictors may predict emerging adult substance use, few studies have focused primarily on the emerging adult outcomes examining predictors from both adolescence and emerging adulthood. This review used the databases {PubMed} and {PsycInfo} to identify articles pertaining to longitudinal predictors of substance use problems in emerging adulthood, building from the conceptual framework presented in a review on risk and protective factors for adolescent substance abuse by Hawkins and colleagues (Hawkins, Catalano, \&amp; Miller, 1992). Predictors identified as predictors of substance use in adolescence, sometimes decreased in strength and in one case reversed direction. Unique predictors in emerging adulthood were also identified. Implications for prevention science during adolescence and emerging adulthood are discussed as well as suggestions for future research.},

The theory is presented in terms of 2 divergent development pathways considered to promote reproductive success in the contexts in which they have arisen. One is characterized, in childhood, by a stressful rearing environment and the development of insecure attachments to parents and subsequent behavior problems; in adolescence by early pubertal development and precocious sexuality; and, in adulthood, by unstable pair bonds and limited investment in child rearing, whereas the other is characterized by the opposite. The relation between this theory and prevailing theories of socialization, specifically, attachment, social-learning, and discrete-emotions theory, is considered and research consistent with our evolutionary theory is reviewed. Finally, directions for future research are discussed.},

Attempting to influence targetable risk and protective factors holds promise for prevention and treatment. Survey data from 1,253 college students (48.5\% male, 26.9\% non-White) were used to investigate the independent and combined effects of two prominent factors, sensation seeking and parental monitoring, on the probability of alcohol and/or cannabis dependence during the first year of college. In multivariate analyses that controlled for high school use, gender, race, mother’s education, and importance of religion, retrospective reports by the student of parental behavior during the last year of high school indicated that higher levels of parental monitoring had a direct effect on reducing risk for alcohol dependence during the first year of college, but not on cannabis dependence. High levels of sensation seeking were associated with increased risk for both alcohol and cannabis dependence. No interaction effects were found. The results extend prior findings by highlighting influences of pre-college parental monitoring and sensation seeking on the probability of alcohol and/or cannabis dependence during the first year of college. The findings also suggest that these two factors are useful in identifying college students at high risk for alcohol and/or cannabis dependence.},

A large, ethnically diverse sample of early adolescents (N = 998) was followed from age 12 to age 23. We tested direct and indirect effects of parental monitoring, family relationship quality, and association with deviant peers on change in substance use across time. Outcomes for tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use were analyzed as separate pathways within the same overall model. The results suggest that a significant shift in the nature of family influence occurred across adolescence and into early adulthood, but deviant peer influence was relatively consistent across this period. Specifically, parental monitoring and deviant peer association were predictive of substance use in early adolescence, but family relationship quality was a significant predictor across the transition to high school and generally continued to predict use into later adolescence, as did association with deviant peers. Deviant peers were the only significant predictor in early adulthood. Our results also suggested that parental monitoring and family relationship quality indirectly predicted later substance use by way of deviant peers, implying that an important aspect of the family context is its influence on choice of friends and peer group composition. Implications for family-based prevention and intervention are discussed.},

The precise nature of the environment is frequently left ill-described, however, and provides a challenge for such approaches, particularly, it is noted here, for the enactive approach which emphasizes this complementarity in quite radical terms. This paper argues that enactivists should work to find common cause with a dynamic form of ecological psychology, a theoretical perspective that provides the most explicit theory of the psychological environment currently extant. In doing so, the intersubjective, cultural nature of the ecology of human psychology is explored, with the challenges this poses for both enactivist and ecological approaches outlined. The theory of behavior settings (; ) is used to present a framework for resolving some of these challenges. Drawing these various strands together an outline of a radical embodied account of intersubjectivity and social activity is presented.},

However, the effect of publication bias in these fields has not been previously addressed or accounted for in the developed meta-analytic methods. In this article, we examine publication bias in functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) for tasks involving working memory in the frontal lobes (Brodmann Areas 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 37, 45, 46, and 47). Seventy-four studies were selected from the literature and the effect of publication bias was examined using a number of regression-based techniques. Pearson’s r correlation coefficient and Cohen’s d effect size estimates were computed for the activation in each study and compared to the study sample size using Egger’s regression, Macaskill’s regression, and the ‘Trim and Fill’ method. Evidence for publication bias was identified in this body of literature (p {\textless} 0.01 for each test), generally, though was neither task- nor sub-region-dependent. While we focused our analysis on this subgroup of brain mapping studies, we believe our findings generalize to the brain imaging literature as a whole and databases seeking to curate their collective results. While neuroimaging databases of summary effects are of enormous value to the community, the potential publication bias should be considered when performing meta-analyses based on database contents.},

	abstract = {Background
The ability to replicate an entire experiment is crucial to the scientific method. With the development of more and more complex paradigms, and the variety of analysis techniques available, {fMRI} studies are becoming harder to reproduce.

Results
In this article, we aim to provide practical advice to {fMRI} researchers not versed in computing, in order to make studies more reproducible. All of these steps require researchers to move towards a more open science, in which all aspects of the experimental method are documented and shared.

Conclusion
Only by sharing experiments, data, metadata, derived data and analysis workflows will neuroimaging establish itself as a true data science.},

However, the increased sophistication of adolescent brain research has made this picture more complex. This review examines functional neuroimaging studies that test for differences in basic emotion processing (reactivity and regulation) between adolescents and either children or adults. We delineated different emotional processing demands across the experimental paradigms in the reviewed studies to synthesize the diverse results. The methods for assessing change (i.e., analytical approach) and cohort characteristics (e.g., age range) were also explored as potential factors influencing study results. Few unifying dimensions were found to successfully distill the results of the reviewed studies. However, this review highlights the potential impact of subtle methodological and analytic differences between studies, need for standardized and theory-driven experimental paradigms, and necessity of analytic approaches that are can adequately test the trajectories of developmental change that have recently been proposed. Recommendations for future research highlight connectivity analyses and non-linear developmental trajectories, which appear to be promising approaches for measuring change across adolescence. Recommendations are made for evaluating gender and biological markers of development beyond chronological age.},

Our approach to developmental and aging longitudinal studies characterizes heterogeneous structural growth/decline between and within groups. In particular, we propose a probabilistic generative model that parameterizes individual and ensemble average changes in brain structure using linear mixed-effects models of age and subject-specific covariates. Model inversion uses Expectation Maximization ({EM}), while voxelwise (empirical) priors on the size of individual differences are estimated from the data. Bayesian inference on individual and group trajectories is realized using Posterior Probability Maps ({PPM}). In addition to parameter inference, the framework affords comparisons of models with varying combinations of model order for fixed and random effects using model evidence. We validate the model in simulations and real {MRI} data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}) project. We further demonstrate how subject specific characteristics contribute to individual differences in longitudinal volume changes in healthy subjects, Mild Cognitive Impairment ({MCI}), and Alzheimer's Disease ({AD}).},

Aside from a small number of recent, conflicting studies, the literature gap on this key issue remains. The present study examines the 54,094 homicide deaths, including 41,123 gun homicides, victimizing California residents ages 15 to 69 during 1991 to 2012 by poverty status. Without controlling for poverty, homicide rates display the traditional age-curve peaking at 19, then declining. When poverty is controlled, the traditional age-curve persists only for high-poverty populations, in which young people are vastly over-represented, and homicide rates are elevated for all ages. This finding reiterates that “adolescent risk taking” may be an artifact of failing to control for age-divergent {SES}.},

Experts in {FMT} used the Riverside Situational Q-sort ({RSQ}) to describe prototypic motive-relevant situations and the Riverside Behavioral Q-sort ({RBQ}) to construct templates representing predictions of how people would behave in them. A sample of 201 undergraduate participants used the {RSQ} to describe situations they had experienced within the past 24 hours, and they described their behavior in each situation using the {RBQ}. For both the {RSQ} and {RBQ}, self-protection and disease avoidance templates were highly similar to each other and different from mate-seeking and affiliation templates. Participants more often reported experiencing situations similar to the mate-seeking, affiliation, and kin care templates and less often reported experiencing situations similar to the self-protection and disease avoidance templates. Participants' reported behavior was consistent with expectations from {FMT}. This study illustrates how relations between situations and behavior can be illuminated through the use of theoretically derived templates.},

Anticipating later evolutionary views of human motivation and cognition, Maslow viewed human motives as based in innate and universal predispositions. We revisit the idea of a motivational hierarchy in light of theoretical developments at the interface of evolutionary biology, anthropology, and psychology. After considering motives at three different levels of analysis, we argue that the basic foundational structure of the pyramid is worth preserving, but that it should be buttressed with a few architectural extensions. By adding a contemporary design feature, connections between fundamental motives and immediate situational threats and opportunities should be highlighted. By incorporating a classical element, these connections can be strengthened by anchoring the hierarchy of human motives more firmly in the bedrock of modern evolutionary theory. We propose a renovated hierarchy of fundamental motives that serves as both an integrative framework and a generative foundation for future empirical research.},

	abstract = {Humans readily adopt an intentional stance to other people, comprehending their behavior as guided by unobservable mental states such as belief, desire, and intention. We used {fMRI} in healthy adults to test the hypothesis that this stance is primed by the default mode of human brain function present when the mind is at rest. We report three findings that support this hypothesis. First, brain regions activated by actively adopting an intentional rather than nonintentional stance to a social stimulus were anatomically similar to those demonstrating default responses to fixation baseline in the same task. Second, moment-to-moment variation in default activity during fixation in the dorsomedial {PFC} was related to the ease with which participants applied an intentional—but not nonintentional—stance to a social stimulus presented moments later. Finally, individuals who showed stronger dorsomedial {PFC} activity at baseline in a separate task were generally more efficient when adopting the intentional stance and reported having greater social skills. These results identify a biological basis for the human tendency to adopt the intentional stance. More broadly, they suggest that the brain's default mode of function may have evolved, in part, as a response to life in a social world.},

	abstract = {With increasing popularity, growth curve modeling is more and more often considered as the 1st choice for analyzing longitudinal data. Although the growth curve approach is often a good choice, other modeling strategies may more directly answer questions of interest. It is common to see researchers fit growth curve models without considering alterative modeling strategies. In this article we compare 3 approaches for analyzing longitudinal data: repeated measures analysis of variance, covariance pattern models, and growth curve models. As all are members of the general linear mixed model family, they represent somewhat different assumptions about the way individuals change. These assumptions result in different patterns of covariation among the residuals around the fixed effects. In this article, we first indicate the kinds of data that are appropriately modeled by each and use real data examples to demonstrate possible problems associated with the blanket selection of the growth curve model. We then present a simulation that indicates the utility of Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion in the selection of a proper residual covariance structure. The results cast doubt on the popular practice of automatically using growth curve modeling for longitudinal data without comparing the fit of different models. Finally, we provide some practical advice for assessing mean changes in the presence of correlated data.},

As predicted, there was a significant interaction between cognitive control and frustration, but not between cognitive control and surgency, in predicting risk-taking behavior.

Then, I describe some of the distinctive characteristics of these students, such as that they tend to be from higher socioeconomic status families and they are disproportionately White and female (which is true of the present student samples as well). I apply this lens briefly to the articles in the special issue, noting some of the ways the college context is important for interpreting the results. Finally, I discuss some possible future directions for this line of research, for example, in comparisons of students such as these to noncollege samples and in cross-national comparisons.},

However, a new body of research highlights the complex, adaptive significance of elevated cortisol within individuals in everyday life. Whereas most studies do not have the power to test the dynamic transactions between cortisol and affect within a person throughout the entire waking day, we employed an intensive study protocol analyzing hourly diary reports of affect in relation to hourly salivary cortisol samples among 24 healthy adults from morning to bedtime, across 2 consecutive weekdays (N = 862 total samples). Utilizing multileveling modeling and focusing on within-person effects, we examined whether momentary increases in cortisol could be mood protective, or energy enhancing, in everyday life, supporting the cortisol boost hypothesis. Results revealed no significant associations between cortisol and current affective state; however, within-person increases in cortisol were significantly associated with subsequent rises in activeness, alertness, and relaxation, and trend-level reductions in stress and nervousness. This study adds to growing evidence that cortisol plays a positive role in regulating affect in everyday life.},

I first review theoretical approaches raised in these articles that I believe are Quixotic dead ends, namely, approaches that are principled and inspired but likely to fail. In the process, I review various theories of amodal symbols, their distortions of grounded theories, and fallacies in the evidence used to support them. Incorporating further contributions across articles, I then sketch a theoretical approach that I believe is likely to be successful, which includes grounding, abstraction, flexibility, explaining classic conceptual phenomena, and making contact with real-world situations. This account further proposes that (1) a key element of grounding is neural reuse, (2) abstraction takes the forms of multimodal compression, distilled abstraction, and distributed linguistic representation (but not amodal symbols), and (3) flexible context-dependent representations are a hallmark of conceptual processing.},

	abstract = {The most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is the theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean six different things. The most common definitions involve the straight-forward claim that “states of the body modify states of the mind.” However, the implications of embodiment are actually much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain, body, and the environment, then the “states of mind” of disembodied cognitive science won’t exist to be modified. Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key steps that research programs should follow in order to fully engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment. The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand. The last step is to test the agent’s performance to confirm that agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and we have the tools we need to realize its full potential.},

	abstract = {Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data is becoming ever more computationally demanding as temporal and spatial resolutions improve, and large, publicly available data sets proliferate. Moreover, methodological improvements in the neuroimaging pipeline, such as non-linear spatial normalization, non-parametric permutation tests and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches, can dramatically increase the computational burden. Despite these challenges, there do not yet exist any {fMRI} software packages which leverage inexpensive and powerful graphics processing units ({GPUs}) to perform these analyses. Here, we therefore present {BROCCOLI}, a free software package written in {OpenCL} (Open Computing Language) that can be used for parallel analysis of {fMRI} data on a large variety of hardware configurations. {BROCCOLI} has, for example, been tested with an Intel {CPU}, an Nvidia {GPU}, and an {AMD} {GPU}. These tests show that parallel processing of {fMRI} data can lead to significantly faster analysis pipelines. This speedup can be achieved on relatively standard hardware, but further, dramatic speed improvements require only a modest investment in {GPU} hardware. {BROCCOLI} (running on a {GPU}) can perform non-linear spatial normalization to a 1 mm3 brain template in 4–6 s, and run a second level permutation test with 10,000 permutations in about a minute. These non-parametric tests are generally more robust than their parametric counterparts, and can also enable more sophisticated analyses by estimating complicated null distributions. Additionally, {BROCCOLI} includes support for Bayesian first-level {fMRI} analysis using a Gibbs sampler. The new software is freely available under {GNU} {GPL}3 and can be downloaded from github (https://github.com/wanderine/{BROCCOLI}/).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00980},
	abstract = {Spatial whole-brain Bayesian modeling of task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) is a serious computational challenge. Most of the currently proposed methods therefore do inference in subregions of the brain separately or do approximate inference without comparison to the true posterior distribution. A popular such method, which is now the standard method for Bayesian single subject analysis in the {SPM} software, is introduced in Penny et al. (2005b). The method does processing slice-by-slice and uses an approximate variational Bayes ({VB}) estimation algorithm that enforces posterior independence between activity coefficients in different voxels. We introduce a fast and practical Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) scheme for exact inference in the same model, both slice-wise and for the whole brain using a 3D prior on activity coefficients. The algorithm exploits sparsity and uses modern techniques for efficient sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions, leading to speed-ups without which {MCMC} would not be a practical option. Using {MCMC}, we are for the first time able to evaluate the approximate {VB} posterior against the exact {MCMC} posterior and show that {VB} can lead to spurious activation. In addition, we develop an improved {VB} method that drops the assumption of independent voxels a posteriori. This algorithm is shown to be much faster than both {MCMC} and the original {VB} for large datasets, with negligible error compared to the {MCMC} posterior.},

Numerous taxa are known to exist in nature and society (chemical elements, biological species, organic diseases, geological strata, kinds of stars, elementary particles, races, cultures, Mendelizing mental deficiencies, major psychoses, vocations, ideologies, religions). What personality types, if any, occur in the nonpathological population remains to be researched by sophisticated methods, and cannot be settled by fiat or “dimensional” preference. The intuitive concept of taxonicity is to be explicated by a combination of formal-numerical and causal criteria. Taxometric methods should include consistency tests that provide Popperian risk of strong discorroboration. In social science, latent class methods are probably more useful than cluster algorithms.},

A formal-numerical definition is needed because intuitive, commonsense notions of “carving nature at its joints” or “identifying natural kinds” cannot resolve disagreements as to taxonic reality for hard cases. Specific etiology (e.g., major gene, germ, traumatic event) is often unknown and is not appropriate in nonmedical domains. Lacking an infallible criterion, the taxonic inference relies on the internal configural relations among the conjectural fallible indicators. An essential feature is multiple consistency tests that will not be satisfied if the latent structure is not taxonic or the parameters are badly estimated. Common misconceptions are that the taxon must be “sharply” distinguished, quantitative indicators must be bimodal, the causal origin must be biological, emergence of a large dimensional factor refutes taxonicity, and adopting a taxon is a mere matter of convention or preference.},

Previous decoding efforts have focused on classifying brain activity into a small set of discrete cognitive states. To attain maximal utility, a decoding framework must be open-ended, systematic, and context-sensitive--i.e., capable of interpreting numerous brain states, presented in arbitrary combinations, in light of prior information. Here we take steps towards this objective by introducing a Bayesian decoding framework based on a novel topic model---Generalized Correspondence Latent Dirichlet Allocation---that learns latent topics from a database of over 11,000 published {fMRI} studies. The model produces highly interpretable, spatially-circumscribed topics that enable flexible decoding of whole-brain images. Importantly, the Bayesian nature of the model allows one to "seed" decoder priors with arbitrary images and text--enabling researchers, for the first time, to generative quantitative, context-sensitive interpretations of whole-brain patterns of brain activity.},

Such flexible developmental arrest is unique among male primates. Among male Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) such long delays appear less common. Here, we develop a simple model to identify the conditions under which developmental arrest can be adaptive. We show that the baseline strategy (i.e., males are not susceptible to arrest) cannot be invaded by the flexible strategy (i.e., males can arrest their development when the conditions are unfavorable) when the potential for high-ranking unflanged or flanged males to monopolize sexual access to females is low. In contrast, at high monopolization potential, the flexible strategy is the evolutionarily stable strategy. We also derive the proportion of flanged males in the population for each combination of monopolization values. This model concurs with field data that found a different monopolization potential between Bornean and Sumatran flanged males and a lower proportion of flanged males in the population in Sumatran orangutans. Pronounced developmental arrest is linked to very low adult mortality, which explains why it is so limited in its taxonomic distribution. Am J Phys Anthropol 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Findings indicated that there were (a) moderate stability paths, (b) small to moderate cross-sectional paths, and (c) only very small cross-lagged paths (though the different situation characteristics and personality states showed differential tendencies toward no directionality, S → P or P → S unidirectionality, or bidirectionality). Findings are discussed in light of refining studies on dynamic person–situation transactions.},

In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the {fMRI} software packages {SPM}, {FSL}, and {AFNI}, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

	abstract = {Here we address an important issue that has been embedded within the neuroimaging community for a long time: the absence of effect estimates in results reporting in the literature. The statistic value itself, as a dimensionless measure, does not provide information on the biophysical interpretation of a study, and it certainly does not represent the whole picture of a study. Unfortunately, in contrast to standard practice in most scientific fields, effect (or amplitude) estimates are usually not provided in most results reporting in the current neuroimaging publications and presentations. Possible reasons underlying this general trend include: 1) lack of general awareness, 2) software limitations, 3) inaccurate estimation of the {BOLD} response, and 4) poor modeling due to our relatively limited understanding of {FMRI} signal components. However, as we discuss here, such reporting damages the reliability and interpretability of the scientific findings themselves, and there is in fact no overwhelming reason for such a practice to persist. In order to promote meaningful interpretation, cross validation, reproducibility, meta and power analyses in neuroimaging, we strongly suggest that, as part of good scientific practice, effect estimates should be reported together with their corresponding statistic values. We provide several easily adaptable recommendations for facilitating this process.},

However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest—in some cases approaching 100\%—when sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application ( http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/ ) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing {SEM}-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.},

Pubertal maturation is advanced by sex hormones, yet it is not clear how best to measure puberty and how well existing measures capture hormone levels. We compared multiple indices of puberty to determine their interrelationships, including the Pubertal Development Scale ({PDS}), a picture-based interview about puberty ({PBIP}) and a physical exam. We also examined how physical pubertal measures were associated with basal hormones responsible for advancing pubertal development. Participants included 160 early adolescents (82 boys, 78 girls), 9-14 years of age. Basal hormones were derived using hierarchical linear modeling from 32 repeated saliva samples of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone ({DHEA}) in both sexes and 5 repeated measures of estradiol in girls. The two self-report measures were moderately concordant with the exam and with each other, with approximately half of the adolescents self-reporting the same stage as the physical exam. The different indices of puberty were highly correlated with each other, suggesting that self-report may be adequate when precise agreement is not necessary. Nevertheless, adolescents who were substantially more or less physically developed than their same-aged peers were most likely to self-report a stage that was different from the physical exam. The physical exam stages correlated well with boys' and girls' testosterone and {DHEA}, and less so with girls' estradiol. With a few exceptions, the {PDS} and {PBIP} were generally related to basal hormones in parallel with the exam. Multiple measures of pubertal development are viable options, each with respective strengths.},

Our goal is to promote better practice in the handling of missing data. We review the current state of missing data methodology and recent missing data reporting in prevention research. We describe antiquated, ad hoc missing data treatments and discuss their limitations. We discuss two modern, principled missing data treatments: multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood, and we offer practical tips on how to best employ these methods in prevention research. The principled missing data treatments that we discuss are couched in terms of how they improve causal and statistical inference in the prevention sciences. Our recommendations are firmly grounded in missing data theory and well-validated statistical principles for handling the missing data issues that are ubiquitous in biosocial and prevention research.

Ss answered questions about their own use and their friend's use of substances, classified their own and their friend's use of each substance according to 6 categories, and completed scales measuring the negative consequences of marihuana and alcohol. The resulting multitrait-multimethod matrix was analyzed in the traditional fashion as well as with confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity for the 3 substance use traits were quite adequate, although the validity of the peer-reported intake measure of alcohol use may be considered inadequate according to some criteria. Results demonstrate the usefulness of multimethod assessment and confirmatory factor analysis for research on construct validity and for derivation of more accurate measures of drug use. (47 ref)},

	shorttitle = {Estimating Psychological Networks and their Stability},
	abstract = {Over the course of the last years, network research has gained increasing popularity in psychological sciences. Especially in clinical psychology and personality research, such psychological networks have been used to complement more traditional latent variable models. While prior publications have tackled the two topics of network psychometrics (how to estimate networks) and network inference (how to interpret networks), the topic of network stability still provides a major challenge: it is unclear how susceptible network structures and graph theoretical measures derived from network models are to sampling error and choices made in the estimation method, greatly limiting the certainty of substantive interpretation. In this tutorial paper, we aim to address these challenges. First, we introduce the current state-of-the-art of network psychometrics and network inference in psychology to allow readers to use this tutorial as a stand-alone to estimate and interpret psychopathological networks in R. Second, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to assess the stability of network parameters. To facilitate this process, we developed the freely available R-package bootnet. We apply bootnet, accompanied by R syntax, to a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online. We show how to estimate confidence intervals around edge weights, and how to examine stability of centrality indices by subsampling nodes and persons. This tutorial is aimed at researchers with all levels of statistical experience, and can also be used by beginners.},

	shorttitle = {The Ape That Thought It Was a Peacock},
	abstract = {This article looks at the evolution of sex differences in sexuality in human beings and asks whether evolutionary psychology sometimes exaggerates these differences. According to a common understanding of sexual selection theory, females in most species invest more than males in their offspring, and as a result, males compete for as many mates as possible, whereas females choose from among the competing males. The males-compete/females-choose ({MCFC}) model applies to many species but is misleading when applied to human beings. This is because males in our species commonly contribute to the rearing of the young, which reduces the sex difference in parental investment. Consequently, sex differences in our species are relatively modest. Rather than males competing and females choosing, humans have a system of mutual courtship: Both sexes are choosy about long-term mates, and both sexes compete for desirable mates. We call this the mutual mate choice ({MMC}) model. Although much of the evolutionary psychology literature is consistent with the {MMC} model, the traditional {MCFC} model exerts a strong influence on the field, distorting the emerging picture of the evolved sexual psychology of Homo sapiens. Specifically, it has led to the exaggeration of the magnitude of human sex differences, an overemphasis on men's short-term mating inclinations, and a relative neglect of male mate choice and female mate competition. We advocate a stronger focus on the {MMC} model.},

	abstract = {Neurodevelopmental origins of functional variation in older age are increasingly being acknowledged, but identification of how early factors impact human brain and cognition throughout life has remained challenging. Much focus has been on age-specific mechanisms affecting neural foundations of cognition and their change. In contrast to this approach, we tested whether cerebral correlates of general cognitive ability ({GCA}) in development could be extended to the rest of the lifespan, and whether early factors traceable to prenatal stages, such as birth weight and parental education, may exert continuous influences. We measured the area of the cerebral cortex in a longitudinal sample of 974 individuals aged 4–88 y (1,633 observations). An extensive cortical region was identified wherein area related positively to {GCA} in development. By tracking area of the cortical region identified in the child sample throughout the lifespan, we showed that the cortical change trajectories of higher and lower {GCA} groups were parallel through life, suggesting continued influences of early life factors. Birth weight and parental education obtained from the Norwegian Mother–Child Cohort study were identified as such early factors of possible life-long influence. Support for a genetic component was obtained in a separate twin sample (Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging), but birth weight in the child sample had an effect on cortical area also when controlling for possible genetic differences in terms of parental height. Our results provide novel evidence for stability in brain–cognition relationships throughout life, and indicate that early life factors impact brain and cognition for the entire life course.},

	abstract = {A leading hypothesis proposes that increased human life span since 1850 has resulted from decreased exposure to childhood infections, which has reduced chronic inflammation and later-life mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer. Early-life cohort mortality rate often predicts later-life survival in humans, but such associations could arise from factors other than disease exposure. Additionally, the impact of early-life disease exposure on reproduction remains unknown, and thus previous work ignores a major component of fitness through which selection acts upon life-history strategy. We collected data from seven 18th- and 19th-century Finnish populations experiencing naturally varying mortality and fertility levels. We quantified early-life disease exposure as the detrended child mortality rate from infectious diseases during an individual’s first 5 y, controlling for important social factors. We found no support for an association between early-life disease exposure and all-cause mortality risk after age 15 or 50. We also found no link between early-life disease exposure and probability of death specifically from cardiovascular disease, stroke, or cancer. Independent of survival, there was no evidence to support associations between early-life disease exposure and any of several aspects of reproductive performance, including lifetime reproductive success and age at first birth, in either males or females. Our results do not support the prevailing assertion that exposure to infectious diseases in early life has long-lasting associations with later-life all-cause mortality risk or mortality putatively linked to chronic inflammation. Variation in adulthood conditions could therefore be the most likely source of recent increases in adult life span.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning theory powerfully characterizes how we learn to benefit ourselves. In this theory, prediction errors—the difference between a predicted and actual outcome of a choice—drive learning. However, we do not operate in a social vacuum. To behave prosocially we must learn the consequences of our actions for other people. Empathy, the ability to vicariously experience and understand the affect of others, is hypothesized to be a critical facilitator of prosocial behaviors, but the link between empathy and prosocial behavior is still unclear. During functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) participants chose between different stimuli that were probabilistically associated with rewards for themselves (self), another person (prosocial), or no one (control). Using computational modeling, we show that people can learn to obtain rewards for others but do so more slowly than when learning to obtain rewards for themselves. {fMRI} revealed that activity in a posterior portion of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex/basal forebrain ({sgACC}) drives learning only when we are acting in a prosocial context and signals a prosocial prediction error conforming to classical principles of reinforcement learning theory. However, there is also substantial variability in the neural and behavioral efficiency of prosocial learning, which is predicted by trait empathy. More empathic people learn more quickly when benefitting others, and their {sgACC} response is the most selective for prosocial learning. We thus reveal a computational mechanism driving prosocial learning in humans. This framework could provide insights into atypical prosocial behavior in those with disorders of social cognition.},

However, it is not clear how to reconcile this idea with the fact that people routinely engage in unpleasant yet necessary activities. To address this issue, we monitored in real time the activities and moods of over 28,000 people across an average of 27 d using a multiplatform smartphone application. We found that people’s choices of activities followed a hedonic flexibility principle. Specifically, people were more likely to engage in mood-increasing activities (e.g., play sports) when they felt bad, and to engage in useful but mood-decreasing activities (e.g., housework) when they felt good. These findings clarify how hedonic considerations shape human behavior. They may explain how humans overcome the allure of short-term gains in happiness to maximize long-term welfare.},

These patterns were replicated in a separate longitudinal dataset, providing additional supportive evidence for the presence of fluctuations in functional network topology over time.

We fit this model in a large (N=555) adult lifespan cohort from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-{CAN}) using multiple measures of processing speed, white matter health and fluid intelligence. The model fit the data well, outperforming competing models and providing evidence for a many-to-one mapping between white matter integrity, processing speed and fluid intelligence.

In an {fMRI} study we recorded brain {BOLD} activity of adolescents (age range = 14–15 years) and adults (age range = 20–39 years) to investigate the developmental changes in reward processing and decision-making. In a probabilistic reversal learning task, adolescents and adults adapted to changes in reward contingencies. We used a reinforcement learning model with an adaptive learning rate for each trial to model the adolescents' and adults' behavior. Results showed that adolescents possessed a shallower slope in the sigmoid curve governing the relation between expected value (the value of the expected feedback, +1 and −1 representing rewarding and punishing feedback, respectively) and probability of stay (selecting the same option as in the previous trial). Trial-by-trial change in expected values after being correct or wrong was significantly different between adolescents and adults. These values were closer to certainty for adults. Additionally, absolute value of model-derived prediction error for adolescents was significantly higher after a correct response but a punishing feedback. At the neural level, {BOLD} correlates of learning rate, expected value, and prediction error did not significantly differ between adolescents and adults. Nor did we see group differences in the prediction error-related {BOLD} signal for different trial types. Our results indicate that adults seem to behaviorally integrate punishing feedback better than adolescents in their estimation of the current state of the contingencies. On the basis of these results, we argue that adolescents made decisions with less certainty when compared with adults and speculate that adolescents acquired a less accurate knowledge of their current state, that is, of being correct or wrong.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade {fMRI} researchers have developed increasingly sensitive techniques for analyzing the information represented in {BOLD} activity. The most popular of these techniques is linear classification, a simple technique for decoding information about experimental stimuli or tasks from patterns of activity across an array of voxels. A more recent development is the voxel-based encoding model, which describes the information about the stimulus or task that is represented in the activity of single voxels. Encoding and decoding are complementary operations: encoding uses stimuli to predict activity while decoding uses activity to predict information about the stimuli. However, in practice these two operations are often confused, and their respective strengths and weaknesses have not been made clear. Here we use the concept of a linearizing feature space to clarify the relationship between encoding and decoding. We show that encoding and decoding operations can both be used to investigate some of the most common questions about how information is represented in the brain. However, focusing on encoding models offers two important advantages over decoding. First, an encoding model can in principle provide a complete functional description of a region of interest, while a decoding model can provide only a partial description. Second, while it is straightforward to derive an optimal decoding model from an encoding model it is much more difficult to derive an encoding model from a decoding model. We propose a systematic modeling approach that begins by estimating an encoding model for every voxel in a scan and ends by using the estimated encoding models to perform decoding.},

	abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and {fMRI} activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

Children move more than adults, older adults more than younger adults, and patients more than controls. Head motion varies considerably among individuals within the same population. Here we explored the influence of head motion on {fcMRI} estimates. Mean head displacement, maximum head displacement, the number of micro movements ({\textgreater} 0.1 mm), and head rotation were estimated in 1000 healthy, young adult subjects each scanned for two resting-state runs on matched 3T scanners. The majority of {fcMRI} variation across subjects was not linked to estimated head motion. However, head motion had significant, systematic effects on {fcMRI} network measures. Head motion was associated with decreased functional coupling in the default and frontoparietal control networks – two networks characterized by coupling among distributed regions of association cortex. Other network measures increased with motion including estimates of local functional coupling and coupling between left and right motor regions – a region pair sometimes used as a control in studies to establish specificity. Comparisons between groups of individuals with subtly different levels of head motion yielded difference maps that could be mistaken for neuronal effects in other contexts. These effects are important to consider when interpreting variation between groups and across individuals.},

	title = {Is Bonferroni correction more sensitive than Random Field Theory for most {fMRI} studies?},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08205},
	abstract = {Random Field Theory has been used in the {fMRI} literature to address the multiple comparisons problem. The method provides an analytical solution for the computation of precise p-values when its assumptions are met. When its assumptions are not met the thresholds generated by Random Field Theory can be more conservative than Bonferroni corrections, which are arguably too stringent for use in {fMRI}. As this has been well documented theoretically it is surprising that a majority of current studies ({\textasciitilde}80\%) would not meet the assumptions of Random Field Theory and therefore would have reduced sensitivity. Specifically most data is not smooth enough to meet the good lattice assumption. Current studies smooth data on average by twice the voxel size which is rarely sufficient to meet the good lattice assumption. The amount of smoothing required for Random Field Theory to produce accurate p-values increases with image resolution and decreases with degrees of freedom. There is no rule of thumb that is valid for all study designs but for typical data (3mm resolution, and greater than 20 subjects) residual smoothness with {FWHM} = 4 times voxel size should produce valid results. However, it should be stressed that for higher spatial resolution and lower degrees of freedom the critical smoothness required will increase sharply. This implies that researchers should carefully choose appropriate smoothing kernels. This can be facilitated by the simulations we provide that identify the critical smoothness at which the application of {RFT} becomes appropriate. For some applications such as presurgical mapping or, imaging of small structures, probing the laminar/columnar structure of the cortex these smoothness requirements may be too great to preserve spatial structure. As such, this study suggests developments are needed in Random Field Theory to fully exploit the resolution of modern neuroimaging.},

Traditional neurobiological and cognitive explanations for adolescent behavior have failed to account for the nonlinear changes in behavior observed during adolescence, relative to both childhood and adulthood. This review provides a biologically plausible model of the neural mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior. We provide evidence from recent human brain imaging and animal studies that there is a heightened responsiveness to incentives and socioemotional contexts during this time, when impulse control is still relatively immature. These findings suggest differential development of bottom-up limbic systems, implicated in incentive and emotional processing, to top-down control systems during adolescence as compared to childhood and adulthood. This developmental pattern may be exacerbated in those adolescents prone to emotional reactivity, increasing the likelihood of poor outcomes.},

Risk-taking, which involves voluntary choices for behaviors where outcomes remain uncertain, undergoes considerable developmental changes during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. In addition, risk-taking is thought to be a key element of many externalizing disorders, such as {ADHD}, delinquency, conduct disorder, and substance abuse. In this review, we will discuss the potential adaptive and nonadaptive properties of risk-taking in childhood and adolescence.


Findings

We propose that the changes in brain architecture and function are a crucial element underlying these developmental trajectories. We first identify how subcortical and cortical interactions are important for understanding risk-taking behavior in adults. Next, we show how developmental changes in this network underlie changes in risk-taking behavior. Finally, we explore how these differences can be important for understanding externalizing behavioral disorders in childhood and adolescence.


Conclusions

We conclude that longitudinal studies are of crucial importance for understanding these developmental trajectories, and many of these studies are currently underway.},

An alternative to machine learning, which tries to establish predictive links between features of the observed data and clinical variables, is the deployment of computational models for inferring on the (patho)physiological and cognitive mechanisms that generate behavioural and neuroimaging responses. This paper discusses the rationale behind a computational approach to neuroimaging-based single-subject inference, focusing on its potential for characterising disease mechanisms in individual subjects and mapping these characterisations to clinical predictions. Following an overview of two main approaches – Bayesian model selection and generative embedding – which can link computational models to individual predictions, we review how these methods accommodate heterogeneity in psychiatric and neurological spectrum disorders, help avoid erroneous interpretations of neuroimaging data, and establish a link between a mechanistic, model-based approach and the statistical perspectives afforded by machine learning.},

In this view, the amygdala is necessary for a person to feel afraid, and when amygdala activity is detected, one can infer that a person is feeling afraid or threatened. In this paper, we review current research on amygdala function that calls into question this threat-specific view and propose a more general view of amygdala functioning based on appraisal theory and psychological constructivism. Specifically, we examine the hypothesis that the amygdala is involved in processing stimulus relevance for the goals and motivations of the perceiver. Thus, although threatening stimuli are almost always considered a relevant stimulus, novel, ambiguous, and extremely positive stimuli can also be relevant for different people in different situations. Once deemed relevant, the amygdala guides processing to orchestrate an appropriate response.},

Existing neurodevelopmental models have integrated our current understanding of adolescent brain development; however, there has been surprisingly little focus on the importance of adolescence as a sensitive period for romantic and sexual development. As young people enter adolescence, one of their primary tasks is to gain knowledge and experience that will allow them to take on the social roles of adults, including engaging in romantic and sexual relationships. By reviewing the relevant human and animal neurodevelopmental literature, this paper highlights how we should move beyond thinking of puberty as simply a set of somatic changes that are critical for physical reproductive maturation. Rather, puberty also involves a set of neurobiological changes that are critical for the social, emotional, and cognitive maturation necessary for reproductive success. The primary goal of this paper is to broaden the research base and dialogue about adolescent romantic and sexual development, in hopes of advancing understanding of sex and romance as important developmental dimensions of health and well-being in adolescence.},

	abstract = {Social dominance results when members of a social group vary in their ability to acquire resources in the presence of others (i.e., compete). Traditional approaches to social dominance often emphasize coercive behavior, but nonetheless suggest that dominant individuals are socially central (e.g., watched, attractive social partners). These patterns, however, apply to humans only up to a certain age. This apparent discontinuity may give the false impression that social dominance is less relevant to human social organization than it is to animal social organization. This paper reintroduces the ethological concept of social dominance, but reinterprets it from a strategy-based perspective. That is, if social dominance is defined as differential ability to control resources—without reference to how this is done—then children evidently employ different strategies to compete with peers (e.g., coercive and prosocial). Furthermore, the type of strategy children employ and peers' responses to it depend largely on the ages of the children. By adopting a strategy-based approach to social dominance and explicitly incorporating developmental processes and uniquely human capacities, human social dominance patterns appear to be more similar to primate patterns than commonly believed. Implications for social competence, peer relationships, and the development of the self are discussed.},

	abstract = {Conventional wisdom and survey data indicate that alcohol is a social lubricant and is consumed for its social effects. In contrast, the experimental literature examining alcohol’s effects within a social context reveals that alcohol does not consistently enhance social-emotional experience. We identify a methodological factor that might explain inconsistent alcohol-administration findings, distinguishing between studies featuring unscripted interactions among naïve participants (k = 18) and those featuring scripted social interactions with individuals identified as study confederates (k = 18). While 89\% of naïve-participant studies find positive effects of alcohol on mood (d = 0.5), only 11\% of confederate studies find evidence of significant alcohol-related mood enhancement (d = −0.01). The naïve-participant versus confederate distinction remains robust after controlling for various moderators including stress manipulations, gender, group size, anxiety outcome measure, and within-group consistency of beverage assignment. Based on the findings of our review, we propose a multidimensional, social-attributional framework for understanding alcohol-related reward. Borrowing organizing principles from attribution theory, the social-attributional approach predicts that alcohol will enhance mood when negative outcomes are perceived to be unstable and/or self-relevant. Our framework proposes that alcohol’s effects within a social context are largely explained by its tendency to free individuals from preoccupation with social rejection, allowing them to access social rewards. The social-attributional approach represents a novel framework for integrating distinct, well-validated concepts derived from several theories of alcohol’s effects. It further presents promising lines of inquiry for future research examining the role of social factors in alcohol reward and addiction susceptibility.},

	abstract = {{PROBLEM}: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.
{REPORTING} {PERIOD} {COVERED}: September 2012-December 2013.
{DESCRIPTION} {OF} {THE} {SYSTEM}: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System ({YRBSS}) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections ({STIs}), including human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, {YRBSS} monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. {YRBSS} includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey ({YRBS}) conducted by {CDC} and state and large urban school district school-based {YRBSs} conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 104 health-risk behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2013 national survey, 42 state surveys, and 21 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12.
{RESULTS}: Results from the 2013 national {YRBS} indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.4\% of high school students nationwide among the 64.7\% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 34.9\% had drunk alcohol, and 23.4\% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 14.8\% had been electronically bullied, 19.6\% had been bullied on school property, and 8.0\% had attempted suicide. Many high school students nationwide are engaged in sexual risk behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancies and {STIs}, including {HIV} infection. Nearly half (46.8\%) of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 34.0\% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 15.0\% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 59.1\% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2013 national {YRBS} also indicate many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 15.7\% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 8.8\% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.0\% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100\% fruit juices and 6.6\% had not eaten vegetables. More than one-third (41.3\%) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day.
{INTERPRETATION}: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health-risk behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-risk behaviors has decreased (e.g., physical fighting, current cigarette use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other health-risk behaviors has not changed (e.g., suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, having ever used marijuana, and having drunk alcohol or used drugs before last sexual intercourse) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concern and obesity and overweight).
{PUBLIC} {HEALTH} {ACTION}: {YRBSS} data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health-risk behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 20 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.},

The measure included years of abstinence from intercourse as well as levels of 3 key heterosexual indicators of risk: frequency of intercourse, number of intercourse partners, and condom use. Predictors included lifetime average measures of contextual, family, and peer process variables and individual behaviors. In addition, similar models for prediction of {STD} contraction were assessed. A younger age of onset of intercourse was associated with higher numbers of intercourse partners after onset. As hypothesized, findings indicated mediational associations of socioeconomic status, parental monitoring, deviant-peer association, antisocial behavior, and substance use in the prediction of sexual risk behavior. Lower condom use also predicted {STD} contraction.},

In order to build the nomological network surrounding this scale, the {UPPS} was administered to individuals with borderline personality disorder ({BPD}), pathological gamblers ({PG}), alcohol abusers (divided into two groups based on the presence of antisocial features), and a control group. Several of the {UPPS} scales (e.g. Urgency, lack of Premeditation, and Sensation Seeking) differentiated the {BPD}, {PG}, and alcohol abusers with antisocial features from a group of non-antisocial alcohol abusers and a control group. Overall, the {UPPS} scales accounted for between 7\% (pathological gambling) and 64\% (borderline personality disorder features) of the overall variance in the psychopathology measures. Individual {UPPS} scales also made unique contributions to several of these disorders, which may provide insight into which of these personality traits may predispose individuals to behave in maladaptive or problematic ways. The results provide support for the differentiation of impulsivity-related constructs into the current four-factor model. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The current longitudinal study examined both personality traits and outcome expectancies as explanations for heavy drinking, drug use, and unsafe sexual behavior among 162 college students. Results indicated that (1) personality and past experience contribute to outcome expectancies, (2) outcome expectancies and personality independently predict substance use at 6-month follow-up, and (3) only past experience predicts subsequent risky sexual behavior. The approach taken in this research offers a bridge between personality theorists and cognitive psychologists who seek to understand why people endanger their lives in pursuit of risky activities.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Although adolescents’ expectations are accurate or moderately optimistic for many significant life events, they greatly overestimate their chances of dying soon. We examine here whether adolescents’ mortality judgments are correlated with their perceptions of direct threats to their survival. Such sensitivity would indicate the importance of ensuring that adolescents have accurate information about those threats, as well as the psychological support needed to deal with them.

Methods
Data from two separate studies were used: a national study of 3,436 14–18 year old adolescents and a regional sample of 124 7th graders and 132 9th graders, 12–16 years old. Participants were asked about their chance of dying in the next year and before age 20, and about the extent of various threats to their physical well being.

Results
Adolescents in both samples greatly overestimated their chance of dying. Those mortality estimates were higher for adolescents who reported direct threats (e.g., an unsafe neighborhood). Thus, adolescents were sensitive to the relative size of threats to their survival, but not to the implications for absolute risk levels.

Conclusions
Contrary to the folk wisdom that adolescents have a unique sense of invulnerability, those studied here reported an exaggerated sense of mortality, which was highest among those reporting greater threats in their lives. Such fears could affect adolescents’ short-term well being and future planning.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00213-016-4431-6},
	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Social cognition influences social interactions. Alcohol reportedly facilitates social interactions. However, the acute effects of alcohol on social cognition are relatively poorly studied.
{METHODS}: We investigated the effects of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer on emotion recognition, empathy, and sexual arousal using the dynamic face emotion recognition task ({FERT}), Multifaceted Empathy Test ({MET}), and Sexual Arousal Task ({SAT}) in a double-blind, random-order, cross-over study in 60 healthy social drinkers. We also assessed subjective effects using visual analog scales ({VASs}), blood alcohol concentrations, and plasma oxytocin levels.
{RESULTS}: Alcohol increased {VAS} ratings of stimulated, happy, talkative, open, and want to be with others. The subjective effects of alcohol were greater in participants with higher trait inhibitedness. Alcohol facilitated the recognition of happy faces on the {FERT} and enhanced emotional empathy for positive stimuli on the {MET}, particularly in participants with low trait empathy. Pictures of explicit sexual content were rated as less pleasant than neutral pictures after non-alcoholic beer but not after alcoholic beer. Explicit sexual pictures were rated as more pleasant after alcoholic beer compared with non-alcoholic beer, particularly in women. Alcohol did not alter the levels of circulating oxytocin.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Alcohol biased emotion recognition toward better decoding of positive emotions and increased emotional concern for positive stimuli. No support was found for a modulatory role of oxytocin. Alcohol also facilitated the viewing of sexual images, consistent with disinhibition, but it did not actually enhance sexual arousal. These effects of alcohol on social cognition likely enhance sociability.

	abstract = {Learning theory and computational accounts suggest that learning depends on errors in outcome prediction as well as changes in processing of or attention to events. These divergent ideas are captured by models, such as Rescorla-Wagner ({RW}) and temporal difference ({TD}) learning on one hand, which emphasize errors as directly driving changes in associative strength, versus models such Pearce-Hall ({PH}) and more recent variants on the other hand, which propose that errors promote changes in associative strength by modulating attention and processing of events. Numerous studies have shown that phasic firing of midbrain dopamine neurons carries a signed error signal consistent with {RW} or {TD} learning theories, and recently we have shown that this signal can be dissociated from attentional correlates in the basolateral amygdala and anterior cingulate. Here we will review this data along with new evidence 1) implicating habenula and striatal regions in supporting error signaling in midbrain dopamine neurons and 2) suggesting that central nucleus of the amygdala and prefrontal regions process the amygdalar attentional signal. However while the neural instantiations of the {RW} and {PH} signals are dissociable and complementary, they may be linked. Any linkage would have implications for understanding why one signal dominates learning in some situations and not others and also for appreciating the potential impact on learning of neuropathological conditions involving altered dopamine or amygdalar function, such as schizophrenia, addiction, or anxiety disorders.},

In this review we highlight difficulties inherent in the frequent use of reverse inference to interpret {SES}-related abnormalities in brain regions that support language. While there is growing evidence suggesting that {SES} moderates children’s developing brain structure and function, no studies to date have elucidated explicitly how these neural findings are related to variations in children’s language abilities, or precisely what it is about {SES} that underlies or contributes to these differences. This issue is complicated by the fact that {SES} is confounded with such linguistic factors as cultural language use, first language, and bilingualism. Thus, {SES}-associated differences in brain regions that support language may not necessarily indicate differences in neurocognitive abilities. In this review we consider the multidimensionality of {SES}, discuss studies that have found {SES}-related differences in structure and function in brain regions that support language, and suggest future directions for studies in the area of cognitive neuroscience of {SES} that are less reliant on reverse inference.},

Life history theory provides an overarching framework for explaining the development of individual differences in reproductive strategies and highlights the role of familial and ecological conditions in regulating pubertal timing. Parental investment and sexual selection models afford a powerful framework for explaining the emergence of sex differences in reproductive strategies and suggest that pubertal timing in males and females is differentially sensitive to psychosocial stress. The West-Eberhard's (2003) model of switch-controlled modular systems provides the foundation for a comprehensive analysis of variation in reproductive strategies at the level of mechanism and development. Applied to puberty, this model provides a framework for explaining how genes and environments interact over development, are modulated by extant phenotypic characteristics, and operate through control of regulatory switch mechanisms across multiple levels of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Taken together, life history theory, parental investment and sexual selection models, and the West-Eberhard framework enable an integrated evolutionary-developmental analysis of between-sex variation and within-sex variation in pubertal processes and their role in regulating alternative life history strategies.},

The authors propose that traits and motives interact in the prediction of behavior: Traits channel the behavioral expression of motives throughout the life course. The authors illustrate this interactive hypothesis in 2 longitudinal studies, focusing on the broad trait of extraversion and the 2 social motives of affiliation and power. In interaction with extraversion, both motives show predicted and replicated relations to independently measured life outcomes in the domains of relationships and careers. Extraversion facilitates unconflicted motive expression, whereas introversion deflects social motives away from their characteristic goals and creates difficulties in goal attainment.},

Significant positive correlations were found between implicit and self-attributed need for achievement and between implicit and self-attributed fear of failure. Individuals higher in self-determination were more concordant in implicit and self-attributed need for achievement. Implicit and self-attributed achievement motives predicted achievement goals in a similar manner, and structural equation modeling yielded good fit for a conceptually parsimonious latent motive model. It is suggested that implicit and self-attributed motives converge in some respects (yet diverge in others), and implications for theory are discussed.},

Furthermore, the extent to which scoring subcategories contribute to overall motive scores has been neglected. Our research with students and managers examined the effectiveness of picture cues in eliciting motive imagery and the prevalence of scoring subcategories within each motive scoring system. Results from 2 data sets comprising 547 men and women suggested that there were 3 cues that should be retained for future research and that motive scoring systems could be refined through removal of redundant subcategories. Further research is needed to systematically investigate the effectiveness of a standard battery of cues and the validity of revised motive scoring systems.},

	shorttitle = {Does the Direction of Effects in the Association Between Depressive Symptoms and Health-Risk Behaviors Differ by Behavior?},
	abstract = {Purpose
Adolescence is associated with the onset of depressive symptoms as well as significant increases in health-risk behaviors. Potential explanations for the direction of effects in the association between depressive symptoms and health-risk behaviors include the self-medication/acting out hypothesis (i.e., early depressive symptoms predict increases in risk behaviors over time) and the failure hypothesis (i.e., early participation in health-risk behaviors predicts increases in depressive symptoms over time). The purpose of the present longitudinal study was to assess these competing hypotheses across the high school years, and to examine whether the direction of effects (and therefore the self-medication/acting out and failure hypotheses) may differ depending on the type of risk behavior under consideration.
Methods
The sample consisted of 4,412 adolescents (49\% female) who were followed up from grade nine to 12. Adolescents reported on their depressive symptoms and six health-risk behaviors (frequency of alcohol use, amount of alcohol consumed per drinking episode, cigarette smoking, marijuana use, hard drug use, and delinquency). Analyses were conducted with dual trajectory growth curve modeling.
Results
Adolescents who had higher depressive symptoms in grade nine reported faster increases than their peers in smoking, marijuana, and hard drug use across the high school years, supporting the self-medication hypothesis. The failure hypothesis was not supported.
Conclusion
The results are important because they suggest that by targeting depressive symptoms during early adolescence, treatment programs may prevent increases in the frequency of these risk behaviors later in adolescence.},

	abstract = {Plasticity refers to changes in the brain that enable an organism to adapt its behavior in the face of changing environmental demands. The evolutionary role of plasticity is to provide the cognitive flexibility to learn from experiences, to monitor the world based on learned predictions, and adjust actions when these predictions are violated. Both progressive (myelination) and regressive (synaptic pruning) brain changes support this type of adaptation. Experience-driven changes in neural connections underlie the ability to learn and update thoughts and behaviors throughout life. Many cognitive and behavioral indices exhibit nonlinear life-span trajectories, suggesting the existence of specific sensitive developmental periods of heightened plasticity. We propose that age-related differences in learning capabilities and behavioral performance reflect the distinct maturational timetable of subcortical learning systems and modulatory prefrontal regions. We focus specifically on the developmental transition of adolescence, during which individuals experience difficulty flexibly adjusting their behavior when confronted with unexpected and emotionally salient events. In this article, we review the findings illustrating this phenomenon and how they vary by individual.},

Examining neural substrates of emotional reactivity may elucidate how {EC} and {PD} differentially influence prosocial behavior. Participants (N = 57) provided measures of {EC}, {PD}, prosocial behavior, and neural responses to emotional expressions at ages 10 and 13. Initial {EC} predicted subsequent prosocial behavior. Initial {EC} and {PD} predicted subsequent reactivity to emotions in the inferior frontal gyrus ({IFG}) and inferior parietal lobule, respectively. Activity in the {IFG}, a region linked to mirror neuron processes, as well as cognitive control and language, mediated the relation between initial {EC} and subsequent prosocial behavior.},

Method and tool development were based on two major goals: 1) to assess the major sources of variation in {fMRI} studies conducted across scanners, including instrumentation, acquisition protocols, challenge tasks, and analysis methods, and 2) to provide a distributed network infrastructure and an associated federated database to host and query large, multi-site, {fMRI} and clinical data sets. In the process of achieving these goals the {FBIRN} test bed generated several multi-scanner brain imaging data sets to be shared with the wider scientific community via the {BIRN} Data Repository ({BDR}). The {FBIRN} Phase 1 data set consists of a traveling subject study of 5 healthy subjects, each scanned on 10 different 1.5 to 4 T scanners. The {FBIRN} Phase 2 and Phase 3 data sets consist of subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder along with healthy comparison subjects scanned at multiple sites. In this paper, we provide concise descriptions of {FBIRN}'s multi-scanner brain imaging data sets and details about the {BIRN} Data Repository instance of the Human Imaging Database ({HID}) used to publicly share the data.},

The second prong is curating the data so that it can be stored in one consistent format and so that data {QA}/{QC} measures can be assured. The third prong is disseminating the data so that it is easy to consume and straightforward to interpret.

	abstract = {The {NIH} {MRI} Study of normal brain development sought to characterize typical brain development in a population of infants, toddlers, children and adolescents/young adults, covering the socio-economic and ethnic diversity of the population of the United States. The study began in 1999 with data collection commencing in 2001 and concluding in 2007. The study was designed with the final goal of providing a controlled-access database; open to qualified researchers and clinicians, which could serve as a powerful tool for elucidating typical brain development and identifying deviations associated with brain-based disorders and diseases, and as a resource for developing computational methods and image processing tools.

This paper focuses on the {DTI} component of the {NIH} {MRI} study of normal brain development. In this work, we describe the {DTI} data acquisition protocols, data processing steps, quality assessment procedures, and data included in the database, along with database access requirements. For more details, visit http://www.pediatricmri.nih.gov.

This longitudinal {DTI} dataset includes raw and processed diffusion data from 498 low resolution (3 mm) {DTI} datasets from 274 unique subjects, and 193 high resolution (2.5 mm) {DTI} datasets from 152 unique subjects. Subjects range in age from 10 days (from date of birth) through 22 years. Additionally, a set of age-specific {DTI} templates are included. This forms one component of the larger {NIH} {MRI} study of normal brain development which also includes T1-, T2-, proton density-weighted, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ({MRS}) imaging data, and demographic, clinical and behavioral data.},

For each subject, socio-demographic data, hand and eye laterality, family handedness, and cognitive abilities in the language, motor, visuo-spatial, and numerical domains have been recorded. T1-{MRI} and {DTI} data were also acquired, as well as resting-state functional {MRI}. Task-evoked functional {MRI} was performed in a sub-sample of 303 subjects (157 left-handers) using a customized functional battery of 16 cognitive tasks exploring the same three cognitive domains. Performances at the tasks executed in the magnet as well as post-acquisition debriefing were recorded.

	abstract = {{SchizConnect} (www.schizconnect.org) is built to address the issues of multiple data repositories in schizophrenia neuroimaging studies. It includes a level of mediation—translating across data sources—so that the user can place one query, e.g. for diffusion images from male individuals with schizophrenia, and find out from across participating data sources how many datasets there are, as well as downloading the imaging and related data. The current version handles the Data Usage Agreements across different studies, as well as interpreting database-specific terminologies into a common framework. New data repositories can also be mediated to bring immediate access to existing datasets. Compared with centralized, upload data sharing models, {SchizConnect} is a unique, virtual database with a focus on schizophrenia and related disorders that can mediate live data as information is being updated at each data source. It is our hope that {SchizConnect} can facilitate testing new hypotheses through aggregated datasets, promoting discovery related to the mechanisms underlying schizophrenic dysfunction.},

The data shared on the site span a broad spectrum of functional and structural brain connectivity information from humans across the entire age range (fetal to age 89), representing an array of different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease populations (autism spectrum disorder, {ADHD}, and {APOE}-4 carriers). An analysis combining 7 different datasets shared on the site illustrates the diversity of the data and the potential for yielding deeper insight by assessing new connectivity matrices with respect to population-wide network properties represented in the {UMCD}.},

	abstract = {Meta-analytic techniques allow cognitive neuroscientists to pool large amounts of data across many individual task-based functional neuroimaging experiments. These methods have been aided by the introduction of online databases such as Brainmap.org or Neurosynth.org, which collate peak activation coordinates obtained from thousands of published studies. Findings from meta-analytic studies typically include brain regions which are consistently activated across studies for specific contrasts, investigating cognitive or clinical hypotheses. These regions can be subsequently used as the basis for seed-based connectivity analysis, or formally compared to neuroimaging data in order to help interpret new findings. To facilitate such approaches, we have developed a new online repository of meta-analytic neuroimaging results, named the Archive of Neuroimaging Meta-analyses ({ANIMA}). The {ANIMA} platform consists of an intuitive online interface for querying, downloading, and contributing data from published meta-analytic studies. Additionally, to aid the process of organizing, visualizing, and working with these data, we present an open-source desktop application called Volume Viewer. Volume Viewer allows users to easily arrange imaging data into composite stacks, and save these sessions as individual files, which can also be uploaded to the {ANIMA} database. The application also allows users to perform basic functions, such as computing conjunctions between images, or extracting regions-of-interest or peak coordinates for further analysis. The introduction of this new resource will enhance the ability of researchers to both share their findings and incorporate existing meta-analytic results into their own research.},

The study of neurostructural development or neurofunctional development has been hampered by the lack of age-appropriate {MRI} reference volumes.

We have created the “Neurodevelopmental {MRI} Database” that provides age-specific reference data from 2 weeks through 89 years of age. The data are presented in fine-grained ages (e.g., 3 months intervals through 1 year; 6 months intervals through 19.5 years; 5 year intervals from 20 through 89 years). The base component of the database at each age is an age-specific average {MRI} template. The average {MRI} templates are accompanied by segmented partial volume estimates for segmenting priors, and a common stereotaxic atlas for infant, pediatric, and adult participants. The database is available online (http://jerlab.psych.sc.edu/{NeurodevelopmentalMRIDatabase}/).},

The data is of particular relevance for neurobiological research questions related to the serotonergic transmitter system with its normative data on the serotonergic subtype receptors 5-{HT}1A, 5-{HT}1B, 5-{HT}2A, and 5-{HT}4 and the 5-{HT} transporter (5-{HTT}), but can easily serve other purposes.

The Cimbi database and Cimbi biobank were formally established in 2008 with the purpose to store the wealth of Cimbi-acquired data in a highly structured and standardized manner in accordance with the regulations issued by the Danish Data Protection Agency as well as to provide a quality-controlled resource for future hypothesis-generating and hypothesis-driven studies.

The Cimbi database currently comprises a total of 1100 {PET} and 1000 structural and functional {MRI} scans and it holds a multitude of additional data, such as genetic and biochemical data, and scores from 17 self-reported questionnaires and from 11 neuropsychological paper/computer tests. The database associated Cimbi biobank currently contains blood and in some instances saliva samples from about 500 healthy volunteers and 300 patients with e.g., major depression, dementia, substance abuse, obesity, and impulsive aggression. Data continue to be added to the Cimbi database and biobank.},

	abstract = {{NeuroVault}.org is dedicated to storing outputs of analyses in the form of statistical maps, parcellations and atlases, a unique strategy that contrasts with most neuroimaging repositories that store raw acquisition data or stereotaxic coordinates. Such maps are indispensable for performing meta-analyses, validating novel methodology, and deciding on precise outlines for regions of interest ({ROIs}). {NeuroVault} is open to maps derived from both healthy and clinical populations, as well as from various imaging modalities ({sMRI}, {fMRI}, {EEG}, {MEG}, {PET}, etc.). The repository uses modern web technologies such as interactive web-based visualization, cognitive decoding, and comparison with other maps to provide researchers with efficient, intuitive tools to improve the understanding of their results. Each dataset and map is assigned a permanent Universal Resource Locator ({URL}), and all of the data is accessible through a {REST} Application Programming Interface ({API}). Additionally, the repository supports the {NIDM}-Results standard and has the ability to parse outputs from popular {FSL} and {SPM} software packages to automatically extract relevant metadata. This ease of use, modern web-integration, and pioneering functionality holds promise to improve the workflow for making inferences about and sharing whole-brain statistical maps.},

The 3T {CONNECTOM} scanner is capable of producing a magnetic field gradient of up to 300 {mT}/m strength for in vivo human brain imaging, which greatly shortens the time spent on diffusion encoding, and decreases the signal loss due to T2 decay. To demonstrate the capability of the novel gradient system, data of healthy adult participants were acquired for this {MGH}–{USC} Adult Diffusion Dataset (N = 35), minimally preprocessed, and shared through the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Image Data Archive ({LONI} {IDA}) and the {WU}–Minn Connectome Database ({ConnectomeDB}). Another purpose of sharing the data is to facilitate methodological studies of diffusion {MRI} ({dMRI}) analyses utilizing high diffusion contrast, which perhaps is not easily feasible with standard {MR} gradient system. In addition, acquisition of the {MGH}–Harvard–{USC} Lifespan Dataset is currently underway to include 120 healthy participants ranging from 8 to 90 years old, which will also be shared through {LONI} {IDA} and {ConnectomeDB}. Here we describe the efforts of the {MGH}–{USC} {HCP} consortium in acquiring and sharing the ultra-high b-value diffusion {MRI} data and provide a report on data preprocessing and access.

The {PAIN} Repository consists of two components, an Archived Repository and a Standardized Repository. Similar to other ‘open’ imaging repositories, neuroimaging researchers can deposit any dataset of chronic pain patients and healthy controls into the Archived Repository. Scans in the Archived Repository can be very diverse in terms of scanning procedures and clinical metadata, complicating the merging of datasets for analyses. The Standardized Repository overcomes these limitations through the use of standardized scanning protocols along with a standardized set of clinical metadata, allowing an unprecedented ability to perform pooled analyses. The Archived Repository currently includes 741 scans and is rapidly growing. The Standardized Repository currently includes 433 scans. Pain conditions currently represented in the {PAIN} repository include: irritable bowel syndrome, vulvodynia, migraine, chronic back pain, and inflammatory bowel disease. Both the {PAIN} Archived and Standardized Repositories promise to be important resources in the field of chronic pain research. The enhanced ability of the Standardized Repository to combine imaging, clinical and other biological datasets from multiple sites in particular make it a unique resource for significant scientific discoveries.},

In this capacity, {XNAT} Central hosts a number of data sets from research labs and investigative efforts from around the world, including the {OASIS} Brains imaging studies, the {NUSDAST} study of schizophrenia, and more. Over time, {XNAT} Central has expanded to include imaging data from many different fields of research, including oncology, orthopedics, cardiology, and animal studies, but continues to emphasize neuroimaging data. Through the use of {XNAT}'s {DICOM} metadata extraction capabilities, {XNAT} Central provides a searchable repository of imaging data that can be referenced by groups, labs, or individuals working in many different areas of research. The future development of {XNAT} Central will be geared towards greater ease of use as a reference library of heterogeneous neuroimaging data and associated synthetic data. It will also become a tool for making data available supporting published research and academic articles.},

As of January 2015, we have data from 750 patients with an expected accrual rate of 200 patients per year. Expansion will accelerate as we extend our collaborations. The main aim of the database is to Predict Language Outcome and Recovery After Stroke ({PLORAS}) on the basis of a single structural (anatomical) brain scan that indexes the stereotactic location and extent of brain damage. Predictions are made for individual patients by indicating how other patients with the most similar brain damage, cognitive abilities and demographic details recovered their language skills over time. Predictions are validated by longitudinal follow-ups of patients who initially presented with speech and language difficulties. The {PLORAS} Database can also be used to predict recovery of other cognitive abilities on the basis of anatomical brain scans. The functional imaging data can be used to understand the neural mechanisms that support recovery from brain damage; and all the data can be used to understand the main sources of inter-subject variability in structure–function mappings in the human brain. Data will be made available for sharing, subject to: funding, ethical approval and patient consent.},

	abstract = {Background
Schizophrenia is a disorder of brain connectivity and altered neurodevelopmental processes. Cross-sectional case-control studies in different age groups have suggested that deficits in cortical thickness in childhood-onset schizophrenia may normalize over time, suggesting a disorder-related difference in cortical growth trajectories.
Methods
We acquired magnetic resonance imaging scans repeated over several years for each subject, in a sample of 106 patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia and 102 age-matched healthy volunteers. Using semiparametric regression, we modeled the effect of schizophrenia on the growth curve of cortical thickness in {\textasciitilde}80,000 locations across the cortex, in the age range 8 to 30 years. In addition, we derived normative developmental modules composed of cortical regions with similar maturational trajectories for cortical thickness in typical brain development.
Results
We found abnormal nonlinear growth processes in prefrontal and temporal areas that have previously been implicated in schizophrenia, distinguishing for the first time between cortical areas with age-constant deficits in cortical thickness and areas whose maturational trajectories are altered in schizophrenia. In addition, we showed that when the brain is divided into five normative developmental modules, the areas with abnormal cortical growth overlap significantly only with the cingulo-fronto-temporal module.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that abnormal cortical development in schizophrenia may be modularized or constrained by the normal community structure of developmental modules of the human brain connectome.},

	abstract = {Understanding the organization of the cerebral cortex remains a central focus of neuroscience. Cortical maps have relied almost exclusively on the examination of postmortem tissue to construct structural, architectonic maps. These maps have invariably distinguished between areas with fewer discernable layers, which have a less complex overall pattern of lamination and lack an internal granular layer, and those with more complex laminar architecture. The former includes several agranular limbic areas, and the latter includes the homotypical and granular areas of association and sensory cortex. Here, we relate these traditional maps to developmental data from noninvasive neuroimaging. Changes in cortical thickness were determined in vivo from 764 neuroanatomic magnetic resonance images acquired longitudinally from 375 typically developing children and young adults. We find differing levels of complexity of cortical growth across the cerebrum, which align closely with established architectonic maps. Cortical regions with simple laminar architecture, including most limbic areas, predominantly show simpler growth trajectories. These areas have clearly identified homologues in all mammalian brains and thus likely evolved in early mammals. In contrast, polysensory and high-order association areas of cortex, the most complex areas in terms of their laminar architecture, also have the most complex developmental trajectories. Some of these areas are unique to, or dramatically expanded in primates, lending an evolutionary significance to the findings. Furthermore, by mapping a key characteristic of these development trajectories (the age of attaining peak cortical thickness) we document the dynamic, heterochronous maturation of the cerebral cortex through time lapse sequences (“movies”).},

In Sample 1, delinquent behavior, as well as impulsivity, sensation seeking and Big Five personality traits, were measured in adolescent twins from the Texas Twin Project. In Sample 2, adult twins from the Australian Twin Registry responded to questionnaires that assessed individual differences in Eysenck's and Cloninger's personality dimensions, and a structured telephone interview that asked participants to retrospectively report {DSM}-defined symptoms of conduct disorder. Bivariate quantitative genetic models were used to identify genetic overlap between personality traits and {ASB}. Across both samples, novelty/sensation seeking and impulsive traits accounted for larger portions of genetic variance in {ASB} than other personality traits. We discuss whether sensation seeking and impulsive personality are causal endophenotypes for {ASB}, or merely index genetic liability for {ASB}.},

	abstract = {The cortical surface is organized into a large number of cortical areas; however, these areas have not been comprehensively mapped in the human. Abrupt transitions in resting-state functional connectivity ({RSFC}) patterns can noninvasively identify locations of putative borders between cortical areas ({RSFC}-boundary mapping; Cohen et al. 2008). Here we describe a technique for using {RSFC}-boundary maps to define parcels that represent putative cortical areas. These parcels had highly homogenous {RSFC} patterns, indicating that they contained one unique {RSFC} signal; furthermore, the parcels were much more homogenous than a null model matched for parcel size when tested in two separate datasets. Several alternative parcellation schemes were tested this way, and no other parcellation was as homogenous as or had as large a difference compared with its null model. The boundary map-derived parcellation contained parcels that overlapped with architectonic mapping of areas 17, 2, 3, and 4. These parcels had a network structure similar to the known network structure of the brain, and their connectivity patterns were reliable across individual subjects. These observations suggest that {RSFC}-boundary map-derived parcels provide information about the location and extent of human cortical areas. A parcellation generated using this method is available at http://www.nil.wustl.edu/labs/petersen/Resources.html.},

After controlling for biological sex, age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status ({SES}), individuals in the lowest cognitive ability group had significantly lower odds of experiencing each type of sex than those in the average ability group. Although individuals in the highest cognitive ability group had significantly lower odds of experiencing vaginal intercourse than those in the average ability group, this association did not remain significant when analyses were stratified by biological sex.

This approach generates a graded level of evidence regarding which model (e.g., effect absent [null hypothesis] vs. effect present [alternative hypothesis]) is more strongly supported by the data.

	shorttitle = {Generalized Network Psychometrics},
	abstract = {We introduce the network model as a formal psychometric model, conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting from pairwise interactions between observable variables in a network structure. This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of Structural Equation Modeling ({SEM}). In the first generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework Latent Network Modeling ({LNM}) and show that, with {LNM}, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance-covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization Residual Network Modeling ({RNM}) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare, {SEM} models, network models, and the {RNM} and {LNM} generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet, which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms performs adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical example on a personality inventory dataset.},

	abstract = {Objective
Although there has been a socioeconomic gradient in smoking prevalence, cessation, and disease burden for decades, these disparities have become even more pronounced over time. The aim of the current study was to develop and test a conceptual model of the mechanisms linking socioeconomic status ({SES}) to smoking cessation.

Design
The conceptual model was evaluated using a latent variable modeling approach in a sample of 424 smokers seeking treatment (34\% African American; 33\% Latino; 33\% White). Hypothesized mechanisms included social support, neighborhood disadvantage, negative affect/stress, agency, and craving.

Main Outcome Measure
The primary outcome was week 4 smoking status.

Results
As hypothesized, {SES} had significant direct and indirect effects on cessation. Specifically, neighborhood disadvantage, social support, negative affect/stress, and agency mediated the relation between {SES} and smoking cessation. A multiple group analysis indicated that the model was a good fit across racial/ethnic groups.

Conclusion
The present study yielded one of the more comprehensive models illuminating the specific mechanisms that link {SES} and smoking cessation. Policy, community, and individual-level interventions that target low {SES} smokers and address the specific pathways identified in the current model could potentially attenuate the impact of {SES} on cessation.},

To attain these objectives, sufficiently powered datasets with broad and deep phenotypic characterization, state-of-the-art neuroimaging, and genetic samples must be generated and made openly available to the scientific community. The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample ({NKI}-{RS}) is a response to this need. {NKI}-{RS} is an ongoing, institutionally-centered endeavor aimed at creating a large-scale (N\&gt;1000), deeply phenotyped, community-ascertained, lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years old) with advanced neuroimaging and genetics. These data will be publically shared, openly and prospectively (i.e., on a weekly basis). Herein, we describe the conceptual basis of the {NKI}-{RS}, including study design, sampling considerations, and steps to synchronize phenotypic and neuroimaging assessment. Additionally, we describe our process for sharing the data with the scientific community while protecting participant confidentiality, maintaining an adequate database, and certifying data integrity. The pilot phase of the {NKI}-{RS}, including challenges in recruiting, characterizing, imaging, and sharing data, is discussed while also explaining how this experience informed the final design of the enhanced {NKI}-{RS}. It is our hope that familiarity with the conceptual underpinnings of the enhanced {NKI}-{RS} will facilitate harmonization with future data collection efforts aimed at advancing psychiatric neuroscience and nosology.},

	abstract = {Based on evolutionary logic, Henrich and Gil-White [Evolution and Human Behavior, 22(3), 165–196] distinguished between two routes to attaining social status in human societies: dominance, based on intimidation, and prestige, based on the possession of skills or expertise. Independently, emotion researchers Tracy and Robins [Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(3), 506–525] demonstrated two distinct forms of pride: hubristic and authentic. Bridging these two lines of research, this paper examines whether hubristic and authentic pride, respectively, may be part of the affective-motivational suite of psychological adaptations underpinning the status-obtaining strategies of dominance and prestige. Support for this hypothesis emerged from two studies employing self-reports (Study 1), and self-and peer-reports of group members on collegiate athletic teams (Study 2). Results from both studies showed that hubristic pride is associated with dominance, whereas authentic pride is associated with prestige. Moreover, the two facets of pride are part of a larger suite of distinctive psychological traits uniquely associated with dominance or prestige. Specifically, dominance is positively associated with traits such as narcissism, aggression, and disagreeableness, whereas prestige is positively associated with traits such as genuine self-esteem, agreeableness, conscientiousness, achievement, advice-giving, and prosociality. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for our understanding of the evolutionary origins of pride and social status, and the interrelations among emotion, personality, and status attainment.},

To test this idea, four groups of subjects played a game in which a fast-moving “demon” made a brief appearance at the bottom of the computer screen, then disappeared behind a V-shaped occluder, and finally re-appeared briefly on either the upper-left or upper-right quadrant of the screen. Points were scored by clicking on the demon during the final reappearance phase. Demons differed in several visible characteristics including color, horn height and eye size. For some subjects, horn height perfectly predicted which side the demon would reappear on. For subjects not told the rule, the subset who demonstrated at the end of the experiment that they had spontaneously discovered the rule showed strong evidence of exploiting it by anticipating the demon's arrival and laying in wait for it. Those who could not verbalize the rule performed no better than a control group for whom the demons moved unpredictably. The implications of this tight linkage between conscious awareness and implicit skill learning are discussed.},

To determine if the Teen Outreach Program ({TOP}), a youth development and service learning program, can reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors compared with a business as usual or benign counterfactual.Methods. We synthesized results of 5 independent studies conducted in 5 geographically and ethnically diverse locations between 2011 and 2015 with 17 194 middle and high school students. Each study cluster-randomized classes, teachers, or schools to treatment or control groups and included the students enrolled in those clusters at baseline in an intent-to-treat analysis. Multilevel models tested impacts on recent sexual activity, recent unprotected sexual activity, and sexual initiation among the sexually inexperienced at baseline at approximately 1 and 2 years after baseline.Results. Precision-weighted average effect sizes showed nonsignificant reductions of 1 percentage point or less in recent sexual activity (5 studies: −0.6; P = .32), recent unprotected sex (5 studies: −0.2; P = .76), and sexual initiation (4 studies: −1.1; P = .10) after 1 year.Conclusions. There was little evidence of the effectiveness of {TOP} in reducing sexual risk-taking behaviors.

Researchers interested in understanding the development of adolescent risk-taking use a diverse array of behavioral and self-report measures to index cognitive control and incentive processing. It is currently unclear whether different measures commonly interpreted as indicators of the same psychological construct do, in fact, tap the same underlying dimension of individual differences. In a diverse sample of 810 adolescent twins and triplets (M age=15.9years, {SD}=1.4years) from the Texas Twin Project, we investigated the factor structure of fifteen self-report and task-based measures relevant to adolescent risk-taking. These measures can be organized into four factors, which we labeled premeditation, fearlessness, cognitive dyscontrol, and reward seeking. Most behavioral measures contained large amounts of task-specific variance; however, most genetic variance in each measure was shared with other measures of the corresponding factor. Behavior genetic analyses further indicated that genetic influences on cognitive dyscontrol overlapped nearly perfectly with genetic influences on {IQ} ({rA}=−0.91). These findings underscore the limitations of using single laboratory tasks in isolation, and indicate that the study of adolescent risk taking will benefit from applying multimethod approaches.},

Yet, how peer status is related to friendship quality and what role social skills play in this association remains unclear. In this study, we use Actor–Partner Interdependence (Mediation) Modeling (Ledermann, Macho, \& Kenny, 2011) to investigate how two forms of peer status, preference and popularity, are related to positive and negative friendship quality in mid-adolescence. Results show that adolescents who are friends with more preferred (i.e., likeable) and popular adolescents report higher friendship quality. These partner effects were partially mediated by adolescents’ own prosocial behavior and their friends’ empathy levels. Higher levels of empathy of one's friend and one's own lesser preference for equity explained why adolescents were more satisfied in a friendship with highly preferred (i.e., likeable) adolescents. Interestingly, empathy was not a mediator for the link between friendship quality and popularity. These findings promote a better understanding of the interplay between different levels of social complexity (i.e., individual, dyadic and peer group level) in adolescence.},

This study examined differences between two groups of subjects, more and less generative adults, in their autobiographical expressions of agency and communion. Employing a new coding system for analyzing themes of agency and communion in significant life-story scenes, the study revealed that highly generative adults express greater levels of communion in their autobiographical scenes than do less generative adults, especially with respect to the communal themes of dialogue and care/help. Highly generative adults also show greater levels of agency/communion integration. However; in the agency themes alone, no significant differences between the two groups emerged.},

Data are presented from a representative sample of 102 males and 99 females, drawn from grades 8, 9, and 10 in public schools in a southern U.S. city, and ranging in age from 13 to 16 years old. Although the sociological models alone look quite satisfactory, the combined models are stronger and give a different picture of the determinants of adolescent sexuality. The combined models show not only additive contributions of sociological and biological variables, but interactions between sociological and hormonal variables. Some sociological relationships are shown to be spurious. In other cases, sociological predictors are shown to be endogenous to biological predictors.},

These styles were characterized by differences in gender, age, and virginity status. The styles, however, were not simply delineated along demographic lines, indicating the efficacy of examining patterns of sexual self characteristics rather than single variables to explore adolescent sexuality. The sexual styles also differed in their levels of sexual risk-taking with both casual and regular partners, number of sexual partners in the last 6 months, and number of "one-night-stands." These differences were coherent with the sexual styles and thus offers both concurrent validity for the styles and an indication that these styles may be associated with sexual behavior. To understand adolescent sexual behavior and sexual risk-taking, it is essential to consider the ways in which young people construct a sense of themselves as sexual beings.},

In this article, Michelle Fine and Sara {McClelland} examine the federal promotion of curricula advocating abstinence only until marriage in public schools and, in particular, how these policies constrict the development of "thick desire" in young women. Their findings highlight the fact that national policies have an uneven impact on young people and disproportionately place the burden on girls, youth of color, teens with disabilities, and lesbian/gay/bisexual/ transgender youth. With these findings in mind, the authors provide a set of research guidelines to encourage researchers, policymakers, and advocates as they collect data on, develop curricula for, and change the contexts in which young people are educated about sexuality and health.},

We then show via functional magnetic resonance imaging that the link between adversity and reward processing is partially mediated by differences in ventral striatal response to rewards.

	abstract = {Most {fMRI} experiments record the brain's responses to samples of stimulus materials (e.g., faces or words). Yet the statistical modeling approaches used in {fMRI} research universally fail to model stimulus variability in a manner that affords population generalization--meaning that researchers' conclusions technically apply only to the precise stimuli used in each study, and cannot be generalized to new stimuli. A direct consequence of this stimulus-as-fixed-effect fallacy is that the majority of published {fMRI} studies have likely overstated the strength of the statistical evidence they report. Here we develop a Bayesian mixed model (the random stimulus model; {RSM}) that addresses this problem, and apply it to a range of {fMRI} datasets. Results demonstrate considerable inflation (50-200\% in most of the studied datasets) of test statistics obtained from standard "summary statistics"-based approaches relative to the corresponding {RSM} models. We demonstrate how {RSMs} can be used to improve parameter estimates, properly control false positive rates, and test novel research hypotheses about stimulus-level variability in human brain responses.},

	abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

	abstract = {The old dogma has always been that the most complex aspects of human emotions are driven by culture; Germans and English are thought to be straight-laced whereas Italians and Indians are effusive. Yet in the last two decades there has been a growing realization that even though culture plays a major role in the final expression of human nature, there must be a basic scaffolding specified by genes. While this is recognized to be true for simple emotions like anger, fear and joy, the relevance of evolutionary arguments for more complex nuances of emotion have been inadequately explored. In this paper we consider envy or jealousy as an example; the feeling evoked when someone is better off than you. Our approach is broadly consistent with traditional evolutionary psychology ({EP}) approaches, but takes it further by exploring the complexity and functional logic of the emotion—and the precise social triggers that elicit them—by using deliberately farfetched, and contrived “thought experiments” that the subject is asked to participate in. When common sense (e.g., we should be jealous of Bill Gates—not of our slightly richer neighbor) appears to contradict observed behavior (i.e., we are more envious of our neighbor) the paradox can often be resolved by evolutionary considerations which h predict the latter. Many—but not all—{EP} approaches fail because evolution and common sense do not make contradictory predictions. Finally, we briefly raise the possibility that gaining deeper insight into the evolutionary origins of certain undesirable emotions or behaviors can help shake them off, and may therefore have therapeutic utility. Such an approach would complement current therapies (such as cognitive behavior therapies, psychoanalysis, psychopharmacologies, and hypnotherapy etc.), rather than negate them.},

	shorttitle = {Conceptual precision is key in acute stress research},
	abstract = {A recent meta-analytic review by Shields, Sazma, and Yonelinas (2016) brings to the fore several conceptual issues within the stress and executive function ({EF}) literatures. We present a critique of these issues, using the review as an exemplar of how stress and {EF} are often examined empirically. The review summarizes research suggesting that {EF} is not only trait-like, but can be also state-like, influenced by factors such as acute stress. It has numerous strengths including its scope in examining {EF} across domains, inclusion of moderators, and timeliness, given the rapidly expanding field of stress research. We argue that the conclusions would be less equivocal with a more precise and neurally-informed consideration of {EF}, stressor, and timing assessments. A detailed discussion of these issues is provided, using the inhibition {EF} domain as an example, in order to illustrate key limitations and potential consequences of broad inclusion criteria. We endeavor to promote precise, shared definitions in the service of delineating a more complete and consistent account of acute stress effects on {EF}.},
