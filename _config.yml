        Broadly, my work focusses on the development of individual differences and their consequences. Specifically, I focus on decision making and social motivation during adolescence, and lifespan development of personality. I take a modeling approach to these problems, which requires deep consideration and sophisticated modeling of the processes that give rise to observed behavior. This has led me to embrace a range of methods that allow flexible modeling, such as multi-level modeling, Bayesian modeling, structural equation modeling, machine learning, and network analysis. 

        Ongoing projects related to adolescent development include cognitive modeling of decision making and learning in multiple contexts, evaluation of the structure of developmental trends, and meta-analysis of neuroimaging literature about reactivity and control processes. In personality development, I am taking a network approach to lifespan longitudinal data.
