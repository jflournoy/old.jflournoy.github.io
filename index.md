Broadly, my work focuses on the **development** of **individual differences** in **cognition** and **motivation**, and their consequences for  **health and well-being**. Specifically, I focus on decision making under uncertainty, and social motivations during adolescence, as well as lifespan development of personality. A modeler at heart, I use sophisticated computational and statistical tools to understand the processes and structures underlying observed behavior in response to games and questionnaires. These tools include multi-level modeling, Bayesian modeling, structural equation modeling, machine learning, and network analysis. In many cases, I also relate behavior to physiological response (e.g., MRI BOLD).

Here is my [**CV**](/cv/johncflournoy-cv.pdf).
