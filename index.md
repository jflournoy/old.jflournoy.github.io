I'm currently a research associate working with Drs. Kate McLaughlin and Leah Somerville at Harvard University. I came here by way of the psychology Ph.D. program at the University of Oregon, and a B.A. in cognitive science at the University of California, Berkeley.

Broadly, I'm interested in the development of decision-making and learning during adolescence, and how these processes, situated in the context of developmentally normative goals and adverse environments, contribute to mental and physical health. 

I am passionate about statistical methodology, especially measurement and modeling task behavior, as well as scientific computing. In addition to my experience supporting projects in adolescent neuroimaging, I have also provided technical and theoretical{%sidenote theory "[There Is Nothing So Theoretical as a Good Method ](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1745691611434210)" %} expertise on longitudinal personality development, dyadic person-perception, and measurement of pubertal development. 

I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="http://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a>, and <a href="https://improvingpsych.org/">The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science</a>.
